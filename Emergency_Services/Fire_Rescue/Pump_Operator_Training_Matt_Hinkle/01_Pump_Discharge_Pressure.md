### Key Components
- Pump Discharge Pressure (PDP)
  - Sum of Total Pressure Loss (TPL) and Nozzle Pressure
  - Covers everything from pump to end of nozzle
- Net Pump Discharge Pressure (NPDP)
  - Difference between incoming and outgoing pressure
  - PDP minus intake pressure

### Total Pressure Loss Components
- Friction Loss
- Elevation Gain/Loss
- Appliance Loss

### Importance
- Critical for proper water flow delivery
- Affects firefighter safety
- Necessary for:
  - Pre-planning fires
  - Apparatus specifications
  - Custom pump chart development

### Terms
- Pump Discharge Pressure (PDP) - The total pressure from the pump to the nozzle end, calculated by adding TPL and nozzle pressure
- Total Pressure Loss (TPL) - Combined losses from friction, elevation changes, and appliances
- Net Pump Discharge Pressure (NPDP) - The difference between outgoing pressure and incoming pressure
- Friction Loss - Pressure loss due to water moving through hose lines
- Appliance Loss - Pressure loss caused by various fittings and equipment
- Nozzle Pressure - The required pressure at the nozzle for proper water flow
