### Importance of Plutonium-238
- Critical nuclear fuel for deep space missions
- Provides reliable power through radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs)
- United States facing a critical shortage of this material
- Final few kilograms currently allocated to specific missions like Dragonfly
- Europa Clipper mission forced to use solar panels instead of RTGs due to shortage

### Properties of Plutonium-238
- Man-made isotope, different from weapons-grade Plutonium-239 by one neutron
- Does not sustain chain reactions, provides steady reliable heat
- Emits alpha particles which generate heat
- Glows red-hot for decades
- Half-life of 88 years, providing long-term power
- Ideal for deep space missions where solar power is ineffective

### History of Production
- Originally produced as byproduct of Cold War nuclear weapons programs
- US halted weapons-grade plutonium production in 1988
- K reactor at Savannah River site closure ended US production capability
- US stopped importing the isotope from Russia in 2010
- DOE and NASA restarted production in 2015

### Requirements for Space Nuclear Fuel
- Long half-life (15-100 years) with high energy density
- Easily shielded radiation (preferably alpha particles only)
- Stability under extreme conditions (launch accidents, re-entry)
- Cost-effective production using existing infrastructure

### Alternative Nuclear Fuels
- Polonium-210: Generates 140 watts per gram but has short half-life (138 days)
- Curium-244: Higher power density but requires more shielding
- Gadolinium-148: Good half-life but requires expensive particle accelerators

### Current Production Process
- Multi-facility, multi-state operation
- Uses neptunium-237 from Cold War stockpile (400kg stored in Indiana)
- Oak Ridge National Laboratory processes neptunium into pellets
- Irradiation in nuclear reactors converts neptunium to plutonium-238
- Chemical separation and purification at Los Alamos National Laboratory
- Current production at 550g per year, targeting 1.5kg annually

### Production Challenges
- Complex statistical process with low yield
- 85% of neptunium-238 destroyed by neutron-triggered fission
- Limited reactor facilities (only High Flux Isotope Reactor and Advanced Test Reactor)
- High competition for reactor time with other research
- Production process requires precise control and expertise

### Electricity Generation from Plutonium-238
- Relies on Seebeck effect to convert heat to electricity
- Uses specialized semiconductors (lead telluride and TAGS)
- Current RTGs operate at only 6-7% efficiency
- Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator project (30% efficiency) was canceled in 2013

### Future Solutions and Applications
- International expansion (ESA/France potentially developing production)
- Scaled production needed for future lunar and deep space missions
- Permanently shadowed lunar craters require non-solar power sources
- Potential for powering rovers, landers, and infrastructure

### Terms
- Plutonium-238: Man-made radioisotope with 88-year half-life that emits heat through alpha decay, used to power deep space missions.
- Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG): Device that converts heat from radioactive decay into electricity using the Seebeck effect.
- Alpha particles: Helium nuclei emitted during radioactive decay that are easily shielded but generate heat.
- Half-life: Time required for half of a radioactive substance to decay, 88 years for Plutonium-238.
- Neptunium-237: Parent isotope used to produce Plutonium-238 through neutron bombardment and beta decay.
- Seebeck effect: Phenomenon where temperature differences between two semiconductors produce an electric current.
- Stirling engine: Heat engine that operates by cyclic compression and expansion of gas to convert heat to mechanical work.
- Dragonfly: NASA's flying rover mission to Saturn's moon Titan, powered by plutonium-238.
