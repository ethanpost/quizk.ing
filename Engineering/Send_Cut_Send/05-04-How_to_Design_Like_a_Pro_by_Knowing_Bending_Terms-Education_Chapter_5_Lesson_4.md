## Bending Terminology Overview

### Introduction
- Bending metal is more complex than folding paper
- Understanding terminology helps diagnose design problems
- Terminology helps fix designs and mitigate errors
- First secondary operation covered in the chapter

### Key Bending Terms

#### Apex
- Imaginary point in space where tangent lines connect
- Not used for calculations but used as reference point
- Used for angle measurements and other measurements

#### Angle
- Measured on the outside of flanges, not the inside
- Important distinction for correct measurements
- If bent past 90°, acute angle appears inside while outside shows larger angle
- SendCutSend automatically calculates angle correctly from STEP files
- Angle appears during DXF checkout process

#### Setback
- Measurement from tangent line to apex
- Two setbacks exist, one on each side of the bend
- Used in later calculations
- Important to understand where measurement comes from

#### Flange Length
- Measured from apex, never from the inside
- Critical measurement point for accuracy
- Measuring from inside causes material thickness to affect calculations
- Ensures correct parts and measurements from manufacturer
- Measured from apex to end of flange

#### Material Thickness
- Thickness at the unbent portion of the bending process
- Raw thickness material form
- Some tolerance exists from mills and coils
- Use average value, don't worry about tolerance
- Denoted as T

#### Center Line
- Center portion between the thickness
- On unbent portion, it's half of the thickness
- Changes during bending process
- Visual representation shown in diagram

#### Bend Radius
- Always measured on the inside of the bend
- Measured at tangent points where bend radius meets flange
- Inside area is always under compression
- Dictated strictly by the punch used in bending process
- Found in manufacturer guidelines (SendCutSend provides effective bend radius at 90°)
- Value comes from manufacturer unless doing it yourself
- Denoted as BR

#### Adjusted Center Line
- Center line of the middle thinned out area during bending
- Material stretches during bending process
- Inside experiences compression, outside experiences tension
- Similar to rubber band thinning when stretched
- Material thins and elongates on outside of bend
- Flanges stretch into desired lengths
- Like throwing a football to where receiver will be, not where they are
- Denoted as little T
- Used in K factor calculations

#### K Factor
- Not a measurement but a ratio
- Describes amount of elasticity or stress stretch in material
- Ratio of adjusted center line (little T) divided by overall material thickness (T)
- One of the most important values for correct CAD setup
- SolidWorks and Fusion 360 have K factor in sheet metal rules
- SendCutSend provides K factor and bend radius list for materials
- Can download sheet metal rules from SendCutSend website
- SendCutSend has bend calculator using all key terms

### Terms
- Apex - An imaginary point in space where tangent lines from the flanges connect, used as a reference point for measurements.
- Angle - The measurement of the bend angle, always measured on the outside of the flanges, not the inside.
- Setback - A measurement from the tangent line (where the bend radius meets the flange) to the apex point, with two setbacks existing on each side of the bend.
- Flange Length - The length of a flange measured from the apex point to the end of the flange, never measured from the inside.
- Material Thickness - The thickness of the material at the unbent portion, denoted as T, representing the raw thickness form.
- Center Line - The center portion between the material thickness, which is half the thickness on the unbent portion.
- Bend Radius - The radius of the bend always measured on the inside of the bend at the tangent points where the bend radius meets the flange, denoted as BR.
- Adjusted Center Line - The center line of the thinned out middle area that occurs during bending due to material stretching, denoted as little T.

## Master Answer Key

1. **A** - The bend angle is measured on the outside of the flanges, not the inside. This is important because if a bend goes past 90°, the inside will show an acute angle while the outside shows the correct larger angle.

2. **C** - The apex is an imaginary point in space where the tangent lines from the flanges connect. While it's not used for calculations, it serves as an important reference point for measurements.

3. **D** - Flange length must be measured from the apex to the end of the flange. Measuring from the inside would cause material thickness to incorrectly affect the calculations.

4. **C** - The bend radius is always measured on the inside of the bend at the tangent points where the bend radius meets the flange, because this area is always under compression.

5. **B** - During bending, the outside of the bend experiences tension and stretches, similar to how a rubber band thins when pulled. This causes the material to thin and elongate.

6. **A** - The K factor is a ratio (not a direct measurement) that describes the amount of elasticity or stress stretch in the material during the bending process. It's critical for proper CAD setup.

7. **C** - The K factor is calculated by dividing the adjusted center line (little T) by the overall material thickness (T). This ratio indicates how much the material stretches during bending.

8. **A** - The adjusted center line differs from the original because the material thins due to stretching on the outside of the bend, similar to how a rubber band thins when stretched.

9. **B** - A setback is a measurement from the tangent line (where the bend radius meets the flange) to the apex point. There are two setbacks, one on each side of the bend.

10. **B** - Measuring flange length from the inside instead of the apex causes material thickness to incorrectly affect the calculations, leading to inaccurate flange lengths.

11. **A** - On the unbent portion of material, the center line is simply half of the material thickness, representing the center point between the top and bottom surfaces.

12. **C** - The bend radius is strictly dictated by the punch used in the bending process. Manufacturers provide the effective bend radius values for their materials.

13. **C** - The inside of a bend experiences compression, being forced into shape by the bending process, which is why the bend radius is measured on the inside.

14. **A** - The effective bend radius at 90° for SendCutSend materials can be found in the manufacturer's guidelines on their website, which provides this information for each material type.

15. **B** - SendCutSend provides comprehensive K factor and bend radius lists for materials that can be downloaded and used in CAD software like SolidWorks or Fusion 360.

16. **B** - The video uses a rubber band as an analogy to explain how material thins and stretches on the outside of a bend, just like a rubber band thins when pulled.

17. **C** - Material thickness (T) refers to the thickness at the unbent portion of the material, representing the raw thickness form before any bending occurs.

18. **A** - False. The apex is not used for calculations but serves as a reference point for measurements like angle, setback, and flange length.

19. **B** - Measuring the angle on the inside instead of the outside gives an incorrect measurement, especially problematic for bends past 90° where the inside shows an acute angle while the outside shows the correct larger angle.

20. **B** - The adjusted center line (little T) is the center line of the thinned out middle area that occurs during bending due to material stretching and thinning on the outside.

21. **C** - When you provide a STEP file to SendCutSend, they automatically calculate the angle correctly. For DXF files, the angle appears during the checkout process for verification.
