## Background and Context

### First Punic War
- Began in 264 BCE over territorial disputes in Sicily
- Conflict between two Mediterranean superpowers
- War lasted 23 years, longer than either side anticipated
- Rome controlled southern Italy while Carthage held territories in North Africa, Spain, Sicily, and other Mediterranean islands

### Strategic Situation
- Initial stages saw Roman land forces advance into Sicily
- Carthaginian naval dominance hindered Roman supply lines
- Romans built 120 warships to challenge Punic naval supremacy
- Romans invented the corvus (boarding bridge) to counter Carthaginian naval experience
- By 256 BCE, Romans aimed to expel Carthage completely from Sicily

## The Battle of Ecnomus (256 BCE)

### Scale and Significance
- One of the largest naval battles in history
- 680 warships total (330 Roman vs 350 Carthaginian)
- Approximately 290,000 participants (rowers and marines)
- Larger than other famous naval battles:
  - Battle of Salamis (Greece vs Persia): ~200,000 men
  - Battle of Lepanto (Holy League vs Ottomans): 484 ships, 150,000 men
  - Spanish Armada vs English Fleet: 330 ships
  - Battle of Jutland (WWI): 250 ships, 100,000 men
  - Battle of Leyte Gulf (WWII): 367 ships, 200,000 men

### Prelude to Battle
- Romans planned invasion of North Africa
- Roman fleet moved down Italian coast to Sicily
- Elite Roman infantry boarded as marines for the invasion force
- Carthaginians gathered their largest fleet in history (350 ships)
- Both fleets advanced along Sicilian coast, meeting at Ecnomus

### Naval Warfare Technology
- Ships primarily quinqueremes ("fives" or "krums")
- Vessels typically 40m long, 5m wide
- Standard complement: 300 rowers, 120 marines per ship
- Carthaginians excelled at ramming tactics
- Romans relied on boarding tactics using the corvus
- Some triremes and larger hexaremes (flagships) were present

## Battle Formations and Strategy

### Roman Formation
- Compact triangular battle order for mutual defense
- Four divisions organized strategically:
  - First two divisions at the triangle's tip, led by consuls Lucius Manlius Vulso and Marcus Atilius Regulus
  - Third division formed the base, towing horse transports
  - Fourth division (nicknamed "Triarii") protected the rear

### Carthaginian Formation
- Commanded by Hamilcar and Hanno
- Traditional line-abreast formation, but with tactical modifications
- Center intentionally weakened to draw Romans in
- Extended flanks to overlap Roman formation
- Left wing deployed toward shoreline
- Right wing (fastest ships) led by Hanno

### Carthaginian Strategy
- Draw Romans into center trap
- Break up compact Roman formation
- Attack from sides and rear
- Similar strategy to what Hannibal would use at Cannae 40 years later

## Battle Execution

### Initial Phase
- Romans noticed Carthaginian center weakness and charged forward
- First and second Roman divisions advanced, creating gap with third and fourth divisions
- Carthaginians initially fell back, luring Romans deeper

### Middle Phase
- Hamilcar signaled counterattack against first and second Roman divisions
- Hanno's right flank circled behind to attack Roman rear (Triarii)
- Carthaginian left flank targeted the vulnerable third division with transports
- Romans cut the horse transports loose and formed defensive line against shoreline
- Battle split into three separate engagements

### Final Phase
- Romans prevailed in center engagement due to corvus effectiveness
- Victorious Roman ships from center joined battle at rear
- Combined Roman forces defeated Hanno's attack
- All Roman divisions converged to rescue third division
- Carthaginians trapped in complete envelopment

## Outcome and Significance

### Battle Results
- Roman victory: 24 ships lost, ~10,000 casualties
- Carthaginian losses: 30 ships sunk, 65 captured, 30,000-40,000 men killed or captured
- Romans successfully landed invasion force in Africa
- Carthaginian tactical plan worked initially but couldn't counter the corvus

### Strategic Impact
- Romans demonstrated resource commitment and resolve
- Regulus's subsequent land invasion ultimately failed
- War continued for another 5 years
- Roman willingness to commit resources fully set them apart
- Battle highlighted Roman adaptability and determination
