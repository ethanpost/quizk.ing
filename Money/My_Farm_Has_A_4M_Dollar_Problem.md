### The Flooding Problem
- Farmers lost nearly $7 billion from flooding last year
- Recent flooding in Vermont devastated crops
- Water-logged soil causes plants to drown and die
- Less than 5% of the narrator's farm has proper drainage
- Professional tiling would cost $4 million
- Self-installation could save $2.5 million

### Field Tile System Components
- Outlet: Lowest point where water exits the system
- Main lines (Mains): Large pipes (8-inch) running along low points
- Laterals: Smaller pipes (4-inch) that connect to main lines
- Perforated drain pipes whisk excess water away
- Slits in pipes allow water in but keep dirt out

### Tiling Installation Process
- Three main steps: Outlet → Main line → Laterals
- Pre-ripping pass to soften soil before pipe installation
- Specialized equipment: tile plow, pull tractor, tile cart
- Boots of different sizes used for different pipe diameters
- Start holes dug to connect laterals to main lines
- Connections made with hole saws

### Economic Analysis
- Self-installation costs approximately $750 per acre
  - Materials: $523 for laterals, $100 for mains
  - Connections: $20 per acre
  - Fuel: $20 per acre
  - Labor: $20 per acre
  - Repairs/maintenance: $67 per acre
- Yield increase of approximately 15 bushels per acre
- Additional revenue of $66 per acre at current prices
- 8.8% return on investment
- Full cost recovery in 9 years

### Long-Term Financial Benefits
- Compounding returns significantly increase value over time
- $132,000 additional annual revenue on 2,000 acres
- Over 25 years: $3.3 million without compounding
- With compounding at 8.8%: potential $16.6 million benefit
- Reinvestment options: more tiling or S&P 500 (10.4% average return)

### Terms
- Field Tile: Perforated drain pipes installed underground to remove excess water from soil
- Outlet: The lowest point where water from the tile system exits, often into a stream or drainage district
- Main Line (Main): Large diameter pipes (typically 8-inch) that run along low points and collect water from laterals
- Laterals: Smaller diameter pipes (typically 4-inch) that connect to main lines and collect water from the field
- Pre-ripping: Process of making a pass with the tile plow to loosen soil before installing pipe
- Pattern Tiling: Systematic installation of parallel tile lines across a field at consistent spacing
- Drainage District: A designated waterway established to collect water from multiple farms' tile systems
- Tile Plow: Specialized equipment that installs drainage pipe underground
- Boot: The part of the tile plow that determines pipe diameter and guides pipe installation
- Rate of Return: Percentage that indicates how quickly an investment pays for itself
- Rule of 72: Formula that estimates years to double investment by dividing 72 by the rate of return
- Compounding: Process where investment returns are reinvested to generate additional returns
