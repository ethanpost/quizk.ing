### Introduction
- Mankind has been perfecting lifting heavy things for thousands of years
- Simple tools and ingenuity allow huge loads to be moved easily
- Machines amplify forces through mechanical advantage
- Mechanical advantage = output force ÷ input force
- Example: 100 kg mass requires 1 kN to lift, but with mechanical advantage of 2, only 0.5 kN needed

### Levers
- Consist of a beam pivoting about a fixed hinge called the fulcrum
- Simplest way of generating mechanical advantage
- Components: load (mass), effort (applied force), fulcrum (pivot point)
- Fulcrum in center: effort equals load (no mechanical advantage)
- Moving fulcrum toward load creates mechanical advantage
- Rotational stability explained through moments
- Moment = force × perpendicular distance from force to point of interest
- For equilibrium: moments about fulcrum must balance
- Mechanical advantage = ratio of distances (b/a)
- Energy conservation: smaller force applied over longer distance equals same energy

### Pulleys
- Wheel with groove for rope/cable
- More complex than levers but offers more mechanical advantage possibilities
- Single pulley: redirects force but provides no mechanical advantage
- Inverted pulley: mechanical advantage of 2
- Mass supported by two rope segments instead of one
- Tension in rope is constant along its length
- Two upward forces of 0.5 kN balance 1 kN downward force
- Adding second pulley allows pulling at angle
- Cost: force divided by 2, but must be applied over double distance
- Multiple pulleys: mechanical advantage of 4 with 4 rope segments
- Block and tackle: movable block with mass, fixed block on ceiling

### Gears
- Simple machines that generate mechanical advantage
- Teeth interlock to form gear trains
- Driver gear: connected to motor/rotating shaft
- Follower gear: receives force from driver gear
- Speed multiplier: small follower gear rotates faster than large driver gear
- Torque: moment about longitudinal axis = force × distance to rotation axis
- Contact force between gears transmits torque
- Mechanical advantage = ratio of gear radii = follower teeth ÷ driver teeth
- Speed multiplier (0.5 mechanical advantage): output speed doubled, torque halved
- Torque multiplier (2 mechanical advantage): output speed halved, torque doubled
- Idler gear: changes rotation direction without affecting mechanical advantage
- Hand winch example: small driver turns large follower for amplified torque

### Hydraulic Systems
- Alternative way to amplify forces
- Use incompressibility of liquids
- Applications: hydraulic presses, aircraft landing gear, flight control systems
