# The History of CAD - Education Chapter 1 Lesson 1

## Course Introduction

### Chapter Overview
- Setting foundation for understanding CAD
- Learning building blocks of drawing
- Building an actual washer with keys part
- Learning new tools and design theories throughout the chapter

### Lesson Focus
- History of CAD as the starting point
- Understanding why history matters for CAD learning

## Pre-CAD Era

### Traditional Design Methods
- Pen and paper drawing
- Manual drafting techniques
- Building complex structures like pyramids, airplanes, and cars without computers

### Problems with Traditional Methods
- Revisions were extremely difficult - required starting over completely
- Required extensive tools and equipment
- Blueprint machines needed for multiple copies
- Time-consuming and error-prone process

## Birth of CAD

### Ivan Sutherland's Innovation (1960s)
- Main pioneer in CAD development
- Created system using light pen
- First computer system that could copy human drawing actions
- Considered the birth of CAD
- Limited functionality - mainly copying, no fancy dimensions

### Early CAD Capabilities
- Basic computer-assisted drawing
- Simple revision capabilities
- Foundation for future developments

## CAD Evolution Timeline

### AutoCAD Era (1982)
- First commercially accessible CAD software
- Available without government contracts
- Dominated market for approximately 8 years
- Made CAD accessible to general public

### 1990s Revolution
- New major players entered the market
- Companies still active today: SolidWorks, ProE, KIA
- Led to significant feature advancements

## Modern CAD Features

### Design for Manufacturing (DFM)
- Focus on manufacturability during design phase
- Integration of manufacturing considerations

### Parametric Design
- Drawings automatically adjust to design changes
- Self-modifying design system
- Foundation for modern CAD workflows

## Educational Philosophy

### Learning Progression
- Start with basic building blocks (lines, circles)
- Build from simple sketching concepts
- Apply same principles used throughout CAD history
- Begin with 2D concepts before advancing to 3D

### Next Steps
- Transition to 2D and 3D concepts
- Understanding why 2D is most important to learn first
