## Master Answer Key

1. **A) To apply all knowledge from chapters 1 through 5 into one cohesive design** - The capstone project is designed to take everything learned from the previous chapters and put it into one cohesive design, serving as a practical application rather than a test.

2. **C) 5.625 inches** - The base dimension for the desk organizer is 5.625 inches (5 and 5/8 inches), which is used consistently throughout the design.

3. **D) The component is grounded to the parent and fixed in space** - The anchor symbol indicates that a component is grounded, meaning it's fixed in space relative to the parent origin and cannot be accidentally moved.

4. **D) To enable mirror features and symmetric operations** - Placing the origin in the center allows for easy use of mirror features and other symmetric operations, as demonstrated when creating the second side wall.

5. **B) 0.063 inches** - The first side component uses 0.063 inch (63 mil) thickness to keep it lightweight and not too bulky.

6. **A) Mirror** - The mirror tool is used to create the second side wall by reflecting the first component across the center plane.

7. **D) If a component disappears, you lose your reference when using a surface** - Using a plane is safer because if you select a surface on a component and that component disappears, you lose your reference, whereas planes remain stable.

8. **C) To prevent cuts and injuries** - The corner radius (fillet) is added specifically to prevent Dom from cutting herself when putting away markers, making it a safety feature.

9. **C) 2 inches** - The inner shelf is positioned 2 inches up from the bottom, creating a 2-inch pocket on the inside of the organizer.

10. **C) Measurement option (outer face vs. interface)** - The measurement option determines whether dimensions are measured from the outer face or the inner face (interface), which affects how the flange extends.

11. **D) To prevent items from falling through to the shelf area** - The false bottom prevents items like pencils and markers from falling all the way down into where the shelf is stored in the back.

12. **C) 0.625 inches** - The mounting flanges use 0.625 inches to provide enough space for #6-32 hardware that will be installed.

13. **B) The corners are automatically chamfered to prevent contact during bending** - When creating flanges on multiple surfaces at corners, the CAD software automatically chamfers the corners to prevent contact issues during the bending process.

14. **D) As a reference to help define geometry but doesn't become part of the final feature** - Construction lines are used as reference geometry to help position and define other sketch elements, but they don't become part of the actual part geometry.

15. **A) To separate markers from pencils** - The divider is specifically created to keep markers separate from pencils in the organizer.

16. **D) The history timeline** - The history timeline allows you to go back and edit features that were created earlier, as demonstrated when editing the shelf flange dimensions.

17. **A) 0.1 inches** - The radius used to match the corners of the back panel to the side components is 0.1 inches (which corresponds to a diameter of 0.2 inches).

18. **D) Locks it into position so it cannot be moved accidentally** - Grounding a component fixes it in space relative to the parent, preventing accidental movement that could disrupt the assembly.

19. **D) When two or more components occupy the same space, preventing proper assembly** - Interference occurs when components overlap in space, which would prevent them from being assembled properly, as seen between some components in this design.

20. **A) To allow independent control of sheet metal rules for each component** - Using "new component" creates separate components that can each have their own sheet metal rules (thickness, bend radius, etc.) controlled independently.

21. **C) Addressing interference, adding hardware holes, through holes, and adding a drawer** - Part 2 will focus on fixing the interference issues identified, adding hardware holes and through holes, and incorporating a drawer into the design.

22. **A) A relationship that ties sketch elements together, such as connecting a point to a line** - Constraints create relationships between sketch elements, like tying a point to a line, which helps define and control the geometry.

23. **B) 3.499 inches** - The measured distance from the inside face to the top of the shelf flange is 3.499 inches, which is very close to 3.5 inches (3 and 1/2 inches).

24. **D) To prevent interference with the bend area** - Setting the divider 0.25 inches up from the radiused corner prevents the divider from interfering with the bend area, avoiding potential deformation issues.
