### Introduction to Cellular Automation
- Comparison between human-made robots and cellular machines
- Modern robots perform thousands of industrial and household tasks
- Future robots will collaborate and make autonomous repairs
- Similar automated processes already exist inside human cells

### Cellular Repair Mechanisms Overview
- Trillions of microbots work continuously inside cells
- Repairs happen 24/7 without conscious awareness
- Repair systems exist throughout the cell:
  - Nucleus (DNA)
  - Cytoplasm (proteins)
  - Cell membrane

### DNA Repair Systems
- DNA carries genetic information that makes us who we are
- Problems with DNA occur continuously
- DNA consists of four nucleotides that spell instructions
- During replication, DNA must be copied accurately
- Key machines in DNA replication:
  - Helicase: unzips DNA strands
  - Polymerase: adds complementary nucleotides
  - Clamp: helps polymerase maintain grip on DNA
  - Clamp loader: positions clamp around DNA
- Error correction mechanisms:
  - Polymerase proofreading capabilities
  - Repair teams for mismatched nucleotides
  - Cutting out errors, filling with fresh DNA
  - Ligase: stitches patches into DNA

### Humans vs. Machines Distinction
- Humans contain sophisticated mechanical parts
- Machines are arrangements of parts for specific tasks
- Living organisms exist for their own purposes
- Machines in cells work for the good of the organism

### Protein Repair and Recycling
- Located in the cytoplasm
- Proteosome: the protein destruction machine
  - Removes damaged proteins
  - Has safety caps to prevent destroying healthy proteins
  - Tag system (ubiquitin) marks damaged proteins
  - Breaks down proteins into reusable amino acids
- Defective proteosome systems linked to diseases like Parkinson's

### Cell Membrane Repair
- Membrane tears occur frequently in active cells
  - Up to 10% of muscle cells have tears
  - Up to 12% of nerve cells have disruptions
  - Up to 25% of heart muscle cells have disruptions
- Repair mechanism triggered by calcium influx
- Hollow spheres of membrane material create patches
- Without repairs, cells with holes survive only minutes

### Conclusion: Origins and Design
- Repair machines are separate systems from what they repair
- First cells required complete maintenance systems from the beginning
- Repair systems show evidence of forethought and purposeful planning
- Presented as products of intelligent design
