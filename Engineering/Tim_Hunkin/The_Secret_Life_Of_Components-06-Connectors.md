## Complete Answer Key

1. **What type of metal are the springy contacts in jack plugs made from?**
   - Answer: B) Phosphor bronze
   - Explanation: Phosphor bronze is chosen because it's springy (returns to shape after bending) and conducts electricity well. The gold coating prevents corrosion and ensures good electrical contact.

2. **What is the current rating of a typical jack plug?**
   - Answer: C) 5 amps
   - Explanation: This rating tells us the maximum safe current the connector can handle. Exceeding this rating can cause overheating and damage to the connector.

3. **What happens when you connect a jack plug to a welder drawing 130 amps?**
   - Answer: B) It melts completely
   - Explanation: Since the welder draws 130 amps but the jack plug is only rated for 5 amps, the massive overload causes extreme heating that melts the connector. This demonstrates why current ratings matter!

4. **To measure current with a multimeter, you must connect it:**
   - Answer: A) In series with the circuit
   - Explanation: Current flows THROUGH the meter, so it must be placed in the path of the current flow (series), not across terminals like voltage measurement (parallel).

5. **The UK mains plug was introduced in what year?**
   - Answer: C) 1947
   - Explanation: This was after World War II when electrical safety standards were being improved. The UK plug design includes many safety features that were revolutionary for the time.

6. **What safety feature makes the earth pin on UK plugs longer than the other pins?**
   - Answer: D) It makes contact first
   - Explanation: This ensures the ground connection is established before power pins connect, providing protection if there's a fault. It's like putting on your seatbelt before starting the car.

7. **What are screw connector strips sometimes called because of their appearance?**
   - Answer: A) Chocolate strip
   - Explanation: They resemble Toblerone chocolate bars with their segmented, rectangular shape. This nickname helps electricians remember what they're talking about!

8. **What is the main problem with cheap screw connectors?**
   - Answer: B) The threads often strip
   - Explanation: Poor quality metal and manufacturing means the screw threads wear out quickly, making connections unreliable and potentially dangerous.

9. **What are bootlace ferrules used for?**
   - Answer: D) Preventing stray wire strands
   - Explanation: These metal tubes crimp onto wire ends, keeping all strands together and preventing them from touching other connections or causing short circuits.

10. **What is the advantage of spring clamp terminals over screw terminals?**
    - Answer: C) They're more reliable
    - Explanation: Spring pressure maintains consistent contact force over time, while screws can loosen with vibration and temperature changes, causing poor connections.

11. **What are the small holes in spring clamp terminals used for?**
    - Answer: A) Testing with multimeter probes
    - Explanation: These holes allow technicians to insert multimeter probes to test voltage or continuity without disconnecting the wires, making troubleshooting much easier.

12. **What are the recessed areas in D-pin connectors called?**
    - Answer: B) Solder buckets
    - Explanation: These cup-shaped areas hold the wire and solder, making it easier to create strong, reliable solder joints. The name helps remember their function!

13. **What is the main advantage of D-pin connectors?**
    - Answer: C) They're easy to solder
    - Explanation: The solder buckets hold everything in place while soldering, making it much easier to create good connections compared to trying to solder loose wires.

14. **What problem can occur with soldered connections?**
    - Answer: D) Stray strands can cause short circuits
    - Explanation: Individual wire strands that escape the solder joint can touch other connections, creating unintended electrical paths that can damage equipment or cause fires.

15. **What is heat shrink tubing used for?**
    - Answer: B) All of the above
    - Explanation: Heat shrink tubing is versatile - it protects connections from moisture and damage, can be labeled with markers, and helps join wires together by providing insulation and strain relief.

16. **How can you shrink heat shrink tubing without a heat gun?**
    - Answer: A) Use a soldering iron
    - Explanation: A soldering iron provides enough heat to shrink the tubing. Just be careful not to touch the tubing directly with the hot tip - use the side of the iron.

17. **What type of connector uses forked metal pieces to puncture insulation?**
    - Answer: C) Punch down connector
    - Explanation: These connectors use sharp metal forks that pierce through wire insulation to make contact with the conductor inside, eliminating the need to strip wires first.

18. **What is the current rating limit for IDC connectors?**
    - Answer: B) 1 amp per core
    - Explanation: IDC (Insulation Displacement Connector) connections have limited contact area, so they can only safely handle low currents. Higher currents would cause overheating.

19. **What is the main advantage of Molex Microfit connectors?**
    - Answer: D) They can handle up to 5 amps
    - Explanation: This higher current rating makes them suitable for more demanding applications compared to other crimp connectors, while still being compact and reliable.

20. **What is the main drawback of Molex Microfit connectors?**
    - Answer: A) They're difficult to test individual wires
    - Explanation: The compact design makes it hard to access individual wire connections for testing, requiring special tools or disassembly to troubleshoot problems.
