## Basic Switch Concepts

### Basic Switch Operation
- Simple circuit with battery, light bulb, and switch
- Switch completes circuit to allow electricity flow
- Two-way switches allow control from multiple locations

### Switch Arcing
- Occurs when switching higher loads, especially motors
- Electricity flow causes air molecules to become ionized
- Ionized air conducts electricity, creating sparks
- Can cause contacts to weld together permanently

### Arc Suppression Methods
- Rapid contact movement (snap action)
- Spring-loaded mechanisms for quick switching
- Capacitor and resistor suppressors across contacts
- Solid state relays for high-load applications

### Switch Types and Applications
- Push button switches (various sizes and styles)
- Foot switches (workshop applications)
- Rotary switches (multiple positions, binary encoding)
- Rocker switches (rectangular hole mounting)
- Toggle switches (test switches, large loads, reversing)
- Micro switches (most commonly used, various actuators)
- Subminiature switches (space-constrained applications)
- Vandalproof switches (public machine controls)
- Mercury switches (obsolete due to toxicity)

### Micro Switch Details
- Different actuator types (button, lever arm, roller)
- Varying actuation forces (30g to 540g)
- Over-travel specifications
- Low torque variants for coin acceptors
- Limit switch applications with diode circuits

### Terms

## Complete Answer Key

1. **What causes arcing in switches when switching high loads?**
   - Answer: B) Air molecules becoming ionized by electricity
   - **Explanation:** When electricity flows through air, it strips electrons from air molecules, creating charged particles (ions). These ionized air molecules can conduct electricity, creating sparks or arcs between switch contacts.

2. **What is the primary purpose of snap-action in switches?**
   - Answer: A) To reduce arcing by moving contacts quickly
   - **Explanation:** Snap-action mechanisms move switch contacts very quickly, minimizing the time they spend in the dangerous arcing zone where electricity can jump through ionized air.

3. **Which type of switch is most commonly used by the speaker in their machines?**
   - Answer: C) Micro switches
   - **Explanation:** Micro switches are small, reliable, and precise. They're perfect for detecting when parts reach specific positions or when buttons are pressed in automated machines.

4. **What is the main advantage of solid state relays over mechanical switches?**
   - Answer: B) They eliminate arcing completely
   - **Explanation:** Solid state relays use electronic components instead of moving metal contacts, so there's no physical gap for electricity to arc across.

5. **Why are silver contacts preferred for low-current switches?**
   - Answer: A) They have particularly low contact resistance
   - **Explanation:** Silver conducts electricity very well, so less energy is lost as heat when current flows through silver contacts, making switches more efficient.

6. **What is the main disadvantage of low torque micro switches?**
   - Answer: D) They have a large difference between switching on and off positions
   - **Explanation:** Low torque switches require very little force to activate, but this means the "on" and "off" positions are far apart, making them less precise.

7. **How are micro switches typically used as limit switches in machines?**
   - Answer: C) To detect when moving parts reach end positions
   - **Explanation:** Limit switches act like safety sensors, telling the machine "stop here!" when a part reaches its intended position, preventing damage from over-travel.

8. **What is the purpose of diodes in limit switch circuits?**
   - Answer: A) To allow current flow in only one direction
   - **Explanation:** Diodes are like one-way valves for electricity. They ensure current only flows in the correct direction, protecting sensitive electronic components.

9. **Why are mercury switches no longer manufactured?**
   - Answer: B) Mercury vapor is toxic and environmentally harmful
   - **Explanation:** Mercury is a dangerous heavy metal that can poison people and contaminate the environment. Modern switches use safer materials instead.

10. **What is the main advantage of rotary switches?**
    - Answer: D) They can have many different positions
    - **Explanation:** Rotary switches can be turned to multiple positions, like a dial, allowing them to control many different settings or circuits with one switch.

11. **What happens when switch contacts arc repeatedly?**
    - Answer: A) The contacts can weld together permanently
    - **Explanation:** Repeated arcing creates intense heat that can melt the metal contacts together, making the switch permanently stuck in one position.

12. **What is the primary reason the speaker prefers toggle switches over rocker switches?**
    - Answer: B) Round holes are easier to drill than rectangular holes
    - **Explanation:** Toggle switches need round holes, which are simpler to drill accurately than the rectangular holes required for rocker switches.

13. **What is the main difference between subminiature switches and regular micro switches?**
    - Answer: C) Subminiature switches are about half the size
    - **Explanation:** Subminiature switches are designed for very tight spaces where every millimeter matters, like inside small electronic devices.

14. **How do two-way switches work?**
    - Answer: D) Either switch can turn the light on or off
    - **Explanation:** Two-way switches allow you to control the same light from two different locations, like at the top and bottom of stairs.

15. **What is the main advantage of using diodes in parallel limit switch circuits?**
    - Answer: A) It prevents the motor from overrunning the switches
    - **Explanation:** Diodes create a "one-way street" for electricity, ensuring motors stop immediately when they hit a limit switch instead of continuing to push against it.

16. **What is the primary consideration when designing vandalproof switches for public machines?**
    - Answer: B) Making the control mechanism incredibly robust
    - **Explanation:** Public machines face rough treatment, so switches must be built extra strong to withstand abuse from frustrated or careless users.

17. **What is the main difference between AC and DC switch ratings?**
    - Answer: C) DC ratings are typically much lower than AC ratings
    - **Explanation:** DC electricity is harder to interrupt than AC because it doesn't naturally stop flowing like AC does, so switches need to be rated for lower DC currents.

18. **What is the primary purpose of over-travel in micro switches?**
    - Answer: D) To allow the actuator to move further after switching occurs
    - **Explanation:** Over-travel provides a safety margin, ensuring the switch activates even if the actuator doesn't hit exactly the right spot.

19. **What is the main advantage of binary-encoded rotary switches?**
    - Answer: B) They can be easily decoded by logic controllers
    - **Explanation:** Binary encoding converts switch positions into digital signals that computers can easily understand and process.

20. **What is the primary reason the speaker uses foot switches in the workshop?**
    - Answer: A) They allow keeping both hands on the work piece
    - **Explanation:** Foot switches free up both hands for holding and positioning work pieces safely, which is especially important when using power tools.

21. **What is the main characteristic of mercury switches that makes them unique?**
    - Answer: C) They use liquid metal as a conductor
    - **Explanation:** Mercury is the only metal that's liquid at room temperature, allowing it to flow and make electrical connections when tilted.
