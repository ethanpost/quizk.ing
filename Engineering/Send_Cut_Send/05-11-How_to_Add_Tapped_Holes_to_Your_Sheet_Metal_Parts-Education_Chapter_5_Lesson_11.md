## Tapped Holes Overview

### Introduction to Tapping
- Tapping is a method for joining parts
- Tapping involves cutting or forming internal threads on a hole
- Focus of this lesson is on through holes for sheet metal
- Holes can be blind holes (don't go all the way through) or through holes

### Tapping Process
- Requires a hole that goes through the part
- Hole is created on the laser side of the process
- Tapping is done as a secondary operation
- Two main methods: forming and cutting

### Forming vs. Cutting Threads
- Forming process pulls and forms threads into desired shape
- Forming is considered a stronger form of threads
- Cutting uses a hardened bit to cut threads into helical pattern
- Cutting creates screw-type threads

### Thread Nomenclature - Imperial
- Depends on whether working in imperial or metric
- UNC stands for Unified National Coarse
- UNF stands for Unified National Fine
- Thread designation includes size (outside diameter) and threads per inch
- Example: 1/4-20 means 1/4 inch diameter with 20 threads per inch
- Threads per inch is measured by counting peaks in one inch of threaded area
- Coarse threads have fewer peaks per inch
- Fine threads have more peaks per inch
- Fine threads provide more thread engagement in thinner material
- Fine threads are prone to galling due to more surface area and contact

### Thread Nomenclature - Metric
- Metric threads don't have fine or coarse designation
- Metric designation includes diameter and pitch
- Example: M5-0.8 means 5mm diameter with 0.8mm pitch
- Pitch is the measurement from peak to peak
- Larger pitch number means coarser thread (more distance between peaks)
- Smaller pitch number means finer thread (less distance between peaks)

### Thread Engagement
- Dictated by the hole size cut through the original part
- Larger hole results in less thread engagement
- Thread engagement refers to how much threads are contacting each other
- Good thread engagement is typically 70% of available surface area
- Contact area between threads is what matters for engagement

### Automatic Hole Resizing
- SendCutSend automatically resizes holes for tapping
- Users don't need to know specific drill size needed
- Selecting thread size (e.g., 1/4-20) automatically sets correct hole size
- System handles laser cutting and tapping setup

### Material Thickness Requirements
- Minimum material thickness is required for tapping
- Thinner material has fewer available threads
- If material is too thin, tapping options become unavailable
- Rule of thumb: one to one and a half times bolt diameter to material thickness
- Rule varies depending on material type and sheet metal cutting
- Hardware installation is alternative for very thin materials

### Expected Results and Limitations
- Oil or residue may be present on parts from cutting process
- Slight burr may occur if deburring process is not selected
- SendCutSend only offers right-handed threads
- Deburring may be needed if not selected during ordering

### CAD Process for Tapped Holes
- Create sketch with circle for hole placement
- Use hole feature in create area
- Select tapped hole type
- Choose thread size from dropdown menu
- Can select imperial or metric threads
- Thread designation and pitch are visible in dialogue box
- Threads are not modeled by default (recommended for manufacturing)
- Picture is drawn on inside of hole to designate threads
- Can check "modeled" option to see physical threads, but not recommended for manufacturing
- Export as DXF and import into SendCutSend
- In SendCutSend, go to hole operations and select tapping
- Can change tap size during checkout process
- System automatically resizes hole for selected tap size

### Terms
- Tapping - The cutting or forming of internal threads on a hole that goes through a part.
- Blind Hole - A hole that doesn't go all the way through a part, used in thicker materials.
- Through Hole - A hole that goes completely through a part, used in sheet metal applications.
- Forming - A tapping process that pulls and forms threads into the desired shape, considered stronger than cutting.
- Cutting - A tapping process that uses a hardened bit to cut threads into a helical pattern.
- UNC (Unified National Coarse) - An imperial thread designation for coarse threads.
- UNF (Unified National Fine) - An imperial thread designation for fine threads.
- Threads Per Inch - A measurement for imperial threads that counts how many thread peaks are in one inch of threaded area.
- Pitch - For metric threads, the measurement from peak to peak between adjacent threads.
- Thread Engagement - How much the threads are contacting each other, typically aiming for 70% of available surface area.
- Coarse Thread - A thread with fewer peaks per inch (imperial) or larger pitch (metric), providing more distance between peaks.
- Fine Thread - A thread with more peaks per inch (imperial) or smaller pitch (metric), providing less distance between peaks.
- Galling - A problem that can occur with fine threads due to increased surface area and contact.
- Right-Handed Thread - A thread that tightens when turned clockwise, the only type offered by SendCutSend.
