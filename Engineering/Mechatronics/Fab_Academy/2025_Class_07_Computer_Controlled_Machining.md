### Tooling
- Endmills vs Drill Bits
  - Drill bits only cut vertically
  - Endmills cut horizontally and vertically
  - Endmills designed for side cutting
- Flute Configurations
  - Range from 1-6 flutes
  - More flutes = smoother finish
  - Fewer flutes = better chip removal
  - Common configurations: 2, 3, or 4 flutes
- Coatings
  - Ceramic layer on surface
  - Extends tool lifetime
  - Different coatings for different materials
- Center Cutting vs Non-Center Cutting
  - Center cutting allows plunging
  - Non-center cutting better for chip removal
  - Center cutting more versatile
- Upcut vs Downcut
  - Upcut lifts material, clean bottom
  - Downcut pushes down, clean top
  - Can use combination for best results
- Specialized Endmills
  - Ballnose for smooth surfaces
  - Long endmills for deep pockets
  - Tapered for fine end cuts
  - Tiny endmills for small features

### Machining Concepts
- Speeds and Feeds
  - Chip load: 1-10,000 in
  - Function of RPM, flute size, and feed rate
  - Too small = rubbing
  - Too large = machine strain
- Cut Depth
  - Typically tool diameter
  - Larger tools = deeper cuts
  - Multiple passes for deep cuts
- Step Over
  - Overlap between passes
  - 0% for rough cutting
  - Up to 90% for finish cutting
- Machining Types
  - Climb: cleaner cut, more force
  - Conventional: rougher cut, less force
  - Rough: quick layers
  - Finish: fine steps
- Tool Paths
  - 2D: like laser cutting
  - 2.5D: multiple depths
  - 3D: all axes movement
  - 4D: rotation while machining
  - 5D: all degrees of freedom
