### Circuit Board Production Methods
- Milling (Direct Write Process)
  - Uses small high-resolution milling machine with tiny endmill
  - Cuts away copper to create traces
  - No setup required - design goes directly to machine
  - Minimal waste (just dust)
  - Not used industrially due to material limitations
  - Preferred for Fab Academy due to speed and simplicity

- Vinyl Cutting
  - Faster than milling (time based on tool movement)
  - Requires weeding process
  - Can create traces that can be placed anywhere
  - Requires encapsulation with clear epoxy for durability
  - Can create multiple layers
  - Some people prefer this method despite its challenges

- Fiber Laser
  - Uses 1 micron wavelength (vs 10 micron for CO2)
  - Can remove copper traces
  - Allows for much smaller feature sizes than milling
  - Can simultaneously handle large areas and tiny features
  - Can apply solder mask and cut board outline
  - More expensive but becoming more affordable

### Materials
- FR1 (Primary material used)
  - Natural fiber in resin
  - No glass reinforcement
  - Machines beautifully
  - Works well for manual soldering
  - Not used commercially due to temperature limitations

- FR4 (Commercial standard)
  - Epoxy with glass
  - Never machined (glass damages tools)
  - Creates hazardous waste
  - Used in commercial production
  - Better heat conductivity

### Soldering Process
- Manual Soldering
  - Requires clean, shiny iron tip
  - Heat both lead and board
  - Flow solder when joint is hot enough
  - Create shiny, smooth joints
  - Avoid cold joints (grainy, lumpy)
  - Watch for solder bridges

- Reflow Soldering
  - Uses stencil and solder paste
  - Heat entire board to melt paste
  - Good for tiny components
  - Can be faster than manual soldering
  - Requires careful temperature control

### Terms
- Dead Bug - Messy wiring between components, not recommended
- Etching - Process of using chemicals to eat away material (not used in Fab Academy)
- Endmill - Cutting tool used in milling process
- V-bit - Tapered cutting tool for fine features
- Solder Bridge - Unwanted connection between pads or leads
- Cold Joint - Poor quality solder connection that appears grainy
- Reflow - Process of melting solder paste to create connections
- Gerber - Standard file format for PCB production
- Via - Connection between different layers of a circuit board
- Solder Mask - Protective layer over copper traces
- Silk Screen - Labeling layer on circuit board
- Pick and Place - Machine for automated component placement
- Stencil - Template for applying solder paste
- Flux - Chemical that helps clean and flow solder joints
