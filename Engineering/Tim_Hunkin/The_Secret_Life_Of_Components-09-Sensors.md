## Master Answer Key

**Question 1 - C) Rubber glove**: Tim demonstrates a simple pressure sensor using a rubber glove that completes a circuit when inflated with compressed air.

**Question 2 - A) It bends due to different expansion rates**: Bimetallic strips consist of two different metals that expand at different rates when heated, causing the strip to bend.

**Question 3 - A) They work with any voltage**: Reed switches make basic switch contacts and can be used with any voltage, unlike powered sensors that require specific voltage supplies.

**Question 4 - A) Through beam sensor**: Through beam sensors have separate transmitter and receiver units, allowing for very long detection distances up to 25 meters.

**Question 5 - B) The difference between switching on and off points**: Hysteresis is a fundamental property of magnetism where there's a measurable difference between the point where a sensor switches on versus when it switches off.

**Question 6 - B) Copper wire**: Tim uses tinned copper wire with intermeshing lines to create a large contact area that changes resistance when dipped in conductive liquids.

**Question 7 - B) Through temperature difference between junctions**: Thermocouples work on the Seebeck effect, generating voltage proportional to the temperature difference between the hot junction and the reference junction.

**Question 8 - C) 3 millimeters**: The tiny inductive sensors Tim prefers have a sensing range of about 3 millimeters, making them very precise for positioning applications.

**Question 9 - B) Diffuse opto sensor**: Tim uses diffuse opto sensors to detect phone placement at very close range in his izombie machine, requiring precise distance sensing.

**Question 10 - C) Pressure inconsistencies**: The corn didn't always fit perfectly over the tube end, causing variable pressure changes that made the vacuum sensors unreliable.

**Question 11 - C) A reed switch with an electromagnetic coil**: Reed relays are reed switches wrapped with electromagnetic coils, allowing electrical control of the magnetic switching.

**Question 12 - C) PIR sensor**: Passive Infrared sensors detect movement by constantly comparing the amount of heat on two halves of the sensor element.

**Question 13 - C) They don't have hysteresis**: Inductive sensors provide very precise positioning without the hysteresis issues that affect reed switches.

**Question 14 - C) All of the above**: Tim uses reed relays, voltage regulators, and transformers to solve various voltage compatibility issues between sensors and control systems.

**Question 15 - B) Capacitive sensor**: Capacitive sensors can detect any material (flesh, clothes, etc.), not just metal, making them versatile but sometimes problematic.

**Question 16 - B) They are never quite as straightforward as they seem**: Tim emphasizes that sensors always have unexpected challenges and require trial and error to get right.

**Question 17 - B) Diffuse opto sensors**: Tim uses diffuse opto sensors with black stripes to detect car position on the track in his "two-ton school run" machine.

**Question 18 - C) Switching direction (positive vs negative)**: NPN sensors switch to negative when activated, while PNP sensors switch to positive, affecting how they connect to control systems.

**Question 19 - D) Inductive sensors**: Coin acceptors use inductive sensors (coils of wire) that detect the different electrical patterns generated by various coins rolling past.

**Question 20 - B) Surface mount reed switches in parallel**: Tim uses surface mount reed switches connected in parallel to create long detection lines, useful for sensing across extended areas.
