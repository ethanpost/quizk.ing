### Basic Principles
- Levers provide mechanical advantage through force multiplication
- Distance from pivot determines leverage ratio
- Longer lever arm requires less force but moves greater distance
- Mechanical advantage = effort distance / load distance

### Levers
- Simple lever: pivot point, effort arm, load arm
- Force multiplication: 4:1 ratio means 4x less effort needed
- Hand tools use levers for cutting and gripping
- Crowbar example: can lift 700kg machine with minimal effort
- Folder brake: wheel clamps metal, arm bends it

### Linkages
- Combining multiple levers creates versatile mechanisms
- Digger arm model shows complex movement capabilities
- Range of motion designed for maximum reach and power
- Can become very complicated but incredibly versatile
- Math gets complex, cardboard models help with design

### Pier Water Clock Linkages
- Multiple interconnected levers create complex sequence
- Water weight triggers tipping mechanism
- Flowers pop up through lever system
- Figure emerges from bath via connected levers
- Tap rotation controlled by additional levers
- Hose movement switches water flow between cans
- Final lever triggers trouser drop sequence

### Linkage Joints
- 3D construction differs from 2D cardboard models
- Weight affects behavior, joints can be wobbly
- Nut and bolt joints can be improved with washers
- Nylock nuts prevent loosening
- Push-fit fasteners provide rigid connections
- Ball joints allow flexibility when needed
- Rose bearings handle larger loads
- Wood hinges useful for prototypes

### Bell Cranks
- Traditional use: summoning servants in grand houses
- Cable systems snake through walls and floors
- Change direction while maintaining tension
- Aircraft applications for weight reduction
- Well-made with bearings on both sides
- Model plane applications for servo connections

### Motor Cranks
- Most commonly used crank type
- Smooth motion with speed variations
- More natural than linear actuators
- Different movements possible by adjusting crank/lever ratios
- Quick return mechanism when connecting rod is short
- Locking cranks prevent unwanted movement
- Physical stops provide secure locking

### Special Cranks
- Locking crank: stops over center for security
- Dropping crank: platform supported by lock mechanism
- Release mechanism triggered by rotating element
- Can handle heavy loads safely

### Crankshafts
- Multiple cranks on single shaft are difficult to make
- Solar sign example with offset cranks (45Â° apart)
- Requires precision alignment and proper materials
- Delrin bearings problematic, better materials needed
- Jig construction helps with accuracy

### Cams
- Provide more complicated movements than cranks
- Hard to get right first time
- Prototype with easy-to-modify materials (hardboard/aluminum)
- Ball race followers reduce friction
- Tiny roller bearings useful for small cams
- Position switches offer alternative to cams
- Stepper motors provide programmable motion

### Complexity Considerations
- Mechanical mechanisms largely replaced by digital
- Analog to digital transition witnessed over career
- Mechanical machines more interesting than digital versions
- Sprinkle digital intelligence on electromechanical base
- Keep it simple stupid (KISS) principle

### Flip Mechanisms
- 180-degree rotation requires special design
- Simple crank maximum angle only ~110-120 degrees
- Pulley system with counterweights provides solution
- Counterweights ensure perfect 180-degree flip
- Used in pier "no smoking" sign for 15+ years

### Capstan Mechanisms
- Torque amplifier: small pull creates large force
- Traditional ship mooring application
- Four wraps optimal for operation
- Friction from pulleys can cause problems
- Mechanical linkage alternative more reliable
- Direct connection provides better feel and timing

## Answer Key

**Question 1:** B - Levers multiply force by reducing the effort needed through mechanical advantage. The longer the lever arm, the less force you need to apply, but you have to move it a greater distance.

**Question 2:** C - Tim demonstrated a 4:1 ratio where his arm moved 4 times further from the pivot than the weight, requiring 4 times less force to lift the same weight.

**Question 3:** B - The shear demonstrates extreme leverage with its long handle (about 1.2 meters) and short cutting jaws that move only about 10mm when the handle moves a foot.

**Question 4:** B - Tim's shear can easily cut 3mm plate due to its mechanical advantage - the long handle provides tremendous force multiplication.

**Question 5:** C - Tim can lift a 700kg machine using a crowbar as a lever. The crowbar acts as a lever with the ground as the pivot point.

**Question 6:** B - Tim uses cardboard and drawing pins to work out linkage designs in 2D before building the actual 3D mechanisms.

**Question 7:** B - Tim uses a digger as an example of complex linkages with multiple interconnected levers that provide extraordinary range of movement.

**Question 8:** B - Water weight in a can triggers the tipping mechanism that starts the flower sequence in the pier water clock.

**Question 9:** C - Nylock nuts have nylon inserts that prevent them from working loose, making them ideal for linkage joints that experience vibration.

**Question 10:** B - Ball joints allow flexibility in linkage movement when needed, accommodating slight misalignments or multi-directional forces.

**Question 11:** B - Bell cranks were traditionally used in grand houses to summon servants via cable systems that snaked through walls and floors.

**Question 12:** D - Motor cranks are the most commonly used type in Tim's machines because they provide smooth, natural motion.

**Question 13:** C - Crank mechanisms provide smoother, more natural motion than linear actuators because they naturally speed up and slow down.

**Question 14:** B - Quick return mechanisms move slowly in one direction and rapidly in the other, achieved when the connecting rod is only slightly longer than the crank.

**Question 15:** B - Locking cranks secure mechanisms in position to prevent unwanted movement, often by stopping over center.

**Question 16:** C - Physical stops provide secure locking by preventing the crank from turning in either direction once it's positioned against the stop.

**Question 17:** B - Multiple cranks on a crankshaft are difficult to make accurately due to alignment requirements and the precision needed for proper operation.

**Question 18:** C - Delrin bearings swelled up either with moisture or heat, causing problems that required replacement with better materials.

**Question 19:** B - Ball races reduce friction and make cam motion smoother by using rolling elements instead of sliding contact.

**Question 20:** A - Position switches provide flexibility through software control, allowing the crank to do different actions at different points in a cycle.

**Question 21:** C - KISS (Keep it simple stupid) is Tim's principle for avoiding unnecessary complexity in mechanism design.

**Question 22:** B - Simple cranks can achieve a maximum angle of about 110-120 degrees, which is surprisingly small compared to what many people expect.

**Question 23:** D - Tim uses pulleys and counterweights to achieve perfect 180-degree rotation. The pulleys provide 2:1 ratio and counterweights ensure complete rotation.

**Question 24:** B - Capstans amplify torque, converting small pulls into large forces through rope friction around the rotating cylinder.

**Question 25:** D - Four wraps around a capstan provide optimal operation - enough friction for amplification but not so much that it becomes difficult to operate.

**Question 26:** B - Friction from pulleys prevented the cord from going completely slack around the capstan, causing the mechanism to behave differently than expected.

**Question 27:** A - Mechanical linkages provide better feel and connection than electronic control because you can directly feel the movement and timing.

**Question 28:** B - KISS stands for "Keep it simple stupid" in engineering design, emphasizing the importance of avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Question 29:** C - Rose bearings are recommended for handling larger loads in linkages because they allow movement in multiple directions while supporting heavy weights.

**Question 30:** B - Bell cranks change direction while maintaining tension in cable systems, allowing cables to snake through buildings while staying taut.

**Question 31:** D - Hardboard or aluminum are easy to modify materials for cam prototyping, allowing Tim to adjust the cam shape until he gets it right.

**Question 32:** B - Any play or slackness gets exaggerated through complicated linkage systems, making them less reliable than simpler designs.

**Question 33:** B - Washers improve nut and bolt joints by reducing friction between the nut and the linkage, making movement smoother.

**Question 34:** C - Stepper motors don't need switches because they're controlled by software pulses that tell them exactly how to move.

**Question 35:** B - Tim calls his platform-dropping mechanism a "dropping crank" because it uses a crank to lift the platform and a lock to hold it until release.

**Question 36:** A - Mechanical machines are more unusual and interesting than digital versions, which is why people are more likely to interact with them.

**Question 37:** B - Tim sprinkles digital intelligence on top of electromechanical machines, combining the best of both mechanical and digital worlds.

**Question 38:** C - Counterweights ensure perfect 180-degree rotation in flip mechanisms by providing the force needed to complete the full rotation.

**Question 39:** C - Capstans only turn in one direction due to their rope-wrapping design - when you pull one way, it turns; when you pull the other way, the rope slackens.

**Question 40:** B - Position switches are more flexible than cams because they're software-controlled, allowing easy changes to the motion pattern.

**Question 41:** B - Tim uses a jig to make crankshaft construction more accurate, ensuring all the cranks are properly aligned and positioned.

**Question 42:** C - Tiny roller bearings reduce friction in small cam applications by using rolling elements instead of sliding contact.

**Question 43:** C - At least 6mm thickness prevents crankshaft sides from bending during welding, maintaining accuracy and strength.

**Question 44:** B - Mechanical linkage makes you feel connected to the boat movement because the bouncing motion is directly transmitted through the physical connection.
