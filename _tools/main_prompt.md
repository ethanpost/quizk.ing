Use the transcript in this file to complete this task to the best of your ability. Think carefully about the problem.

You will create a new Markdown file.

You will create a quiz that contains the most relevant information and not a lot of trivial details.

1. Generate a detailed outline that includes major and minor points from the material in the transcript. Make sure to conclude the outline with a detailed list of terms and thier definitions. Outlines should follow the format of the following example:

## Ancient Egypt Overview

### Time Period
- Old Kingdom (2686-2181 BCE)
- Pyramid building era
- First unified Egyptian state
- Rule of pharaohs from Memphis
- Middle Kingdom (2055-1650 BCE)
- Cultural renaissance
- Expansion of territory
- Growth of literature and art
### Terms
- Pyramid - A large stone structure built as a tomb for a pharaoh and their consorts.
- Pharoh - The ruler of Egypt.

2. Add a "///" string below the outline with a blank line above and below the string.

3. Make sure when generating quiz questions that the answers are evenly distributed across the options list.

4. Generate a quiz. Create a multiple choice quiz from the transcript. Make sure you adhere to the following rules. Do not number the questions. You can create True/False questions or multiple choice questions. A True/False question should have two possible answers, True or False. Create as many questions as needed to cover all of the content. Better to error on the side of too many questions than not enough. Make sure blank lines are always between every line. Make sure to include questions for each of the terms in the outline. "---" should be placed between each question and the answer options. A "---" should also be place between the anser optons and the correct answer. The correct answer should only be the correct text and not the letter of the answer option. Make sure to distribute correct answers evenly across the options list, correct answers should not be predominantly B or C. Each questions should end with a "///" on a new line. See the example below:
