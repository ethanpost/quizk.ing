## Indo-European Languages Verb Tense System

### Time and Aspect Framework
- Tenses are combinations of time and aspect
- Three time periods: present, past, future
- Two aspects: continual and completed
- Six tenses result from combining time and aspect

### Continual Aspect
- Action happens throughout the time period
- In English: form of "to be" + -ing form of verb
  - Present continual: "I am loving"
  - Past continual: "I was loving" 
  - Future continual: "I will be loving"
- In Latin: present system
  - Present tense
  - Imperfect tense
  - Future tense
- All formed with verb stem from second principal part

### Completed Aspect
- Action is already finished but connected to time period
- In English: form of "to have" + -ed form of verb
  - Present completed: "I have loved"
  - Past completed: "I had loved"
  - Future completed: "I will have loved"
- In Latin: perfect system
  - Perfect tense
  - Pluperfect tense
  - Future perfect tense
- All formed with perfect stem (third principal part)
- Pluperfect and future perfect add past/future of "to be" to perfect stem

### Simple Aspect (Additional)
- Shows action that happens once or is generally true
- In English:
  - Present simple: "I love"
  - Past simple: "I loved" (many irregular forms)
  - Future simple: "I will love"
- In Latin (adaptation):
  - Present and future borrow from continual aspect
  - Past simple borrows perfect tense
  - Perfect tense serves dual purpose: completed present and simple past

### Sir Charles Napier Example
- Illustrates difference between uses of perfect tense
- "Peccavi" means both "I have sinned" and "I have Sindh"

### Terms
- Tense - A grammatical category that localizes a situation in time and indicates its aspect
- Aspect - A grammatical category that expresses how an action, event, or state extends over time
- Continual Aspect - Where the action is happening throughout the time period
- Completed Aspect - Where the action is already finished but connected to the time period
- Simple Aspect - Shows an action that happens once or is generally true
- Present System - The Latin tenses formed from the second principal part: present, imperfect, and future
- Perfect System - The Latin tenses formed from the third principal part: perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect
- Aorist - A tense found in some languages like Ancient Greek, representing a simple past action
