## Outline

### Introduction to Material Selection
- Material selection is driven by project requirements and constraints
- Material selection is part of Design for Manufacturing (DFM)
- The equation: Material + Machine = Reality
- This lesson focuses on the material component of the equation
- Two examples used throughout: front fork and chain tensioner for motorcycles

### Understanding Requirements and Constraints
- First step in material selection is understanding requirements and constraints
- Process involves working through a systematic list
- List helps funnel down material options to the right choice
- Each criterion eliminates materials that don't fit

### Material Characteristics
- Corrosion resistance
  - Important for outdoor applications (e.g., salt on roads)
  - Stainless steel and aluminum are corrosion resistant
  - Steel parts should be avoided when rust is a concern
- Wear resistance
  - Front fork doesn't need high wear resistance
  - Chain tensioner requires wear resistance
  - Aluminum may not be suitable for high-wear applications
- Chemical resistance
  - Consider exposure to chemicals in the application
  - May not be critical for all projects

### Machinability and Formability
- Machinability/formability must match the manufacturing process
- Some materials work for certain processes but not others
- Example: 6000 series aluminum cannot be bent, eliminating it for certain applications
- Process capability affects material selection
- Materials are eliminated based on manufacturing constraints

### Cost Considerations
- Cost is always a factor in material selection
- Budget constraints vary by project and organization
- Large corporations may have different cost priorities than individual projects
- Stainless steel is generally more expensive than aluminum
- Cost can be a deciding factor when other criteria are met by multiple materials

### Tolerances
- Raw materials come with inherent tolerances
- Tighter tolerances increase cost
- Manufacturing machines affect achievable tolerances
- Different materials machine to different tolerance levels
- Softer materials generally hold tighter tolerances more easily
- Tolerance requirements help narrow material choices

### Surface Finish
- Surface finish is primarily a cosmetic consideration
- Important for customer-facing parts
- Example: Anodized clear aluminum provides appealing appearance
- Stainless steel also offers good cosmetic properties
- Understanding the finished product appearance guides material choice

### Weight
- Weight is an important factor for many applications
- Motorcycles benefit from lighter weight
- Stainless steel is heavier than aluminum
- Material choice affects overall product weight
- Weight considerations are balanced with other requirements

### Lead Time
- Lead time importance depends on project scale
- Single parts may not have lead time constraints
- Production runs require lead time consideration
- Some materials are harder to acquire than others
- Material availability affects selection decisions

### Material Selection Process
- Systematic approach funnels materials down to specific choice
- Each criterion eliminates non-viable options
- Final material selection leads to next design decisions
- Process connects to material form selection (next lesson topic)

### Terms
- Design for Manufacturing (DFM) - The practice of designing products with manufacturing realities in mind, combining real-world constraints with CAD design
- Corrosion resistance - A material's ability to resist deterioration from environmental factors like moisture, salt, or chemicals
- Wear resistance - A material's ability to withstand friction and abrasion without significant degradation
- Machinability - The ease with which a material can be cut, shaped, or formed using machine tools
- Formability - A material's ability to be bent, shaped, or formed into desired geometries without cracking or breaking
- Tolerance - The allowable variation in a dimension or property of a material or finished part
- Surface finish - The texture, appearance, and quality of a material's outer surface
- Lead time - The time required to acquire materials or complete manufacturing processes
