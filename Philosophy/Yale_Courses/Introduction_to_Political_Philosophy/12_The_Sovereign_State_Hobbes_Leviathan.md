### Introduction to Hobbes
- Author of the greatest work of political theory in English language
- Master of English style and prose
- Leviathan (1651) comparable to Milton's Paradise Lost in importance
- Perfect foil for Machiavelli - carried out what Machiavelli made possible
- Provided definitive language for discussing the modern state

### Hobbes as a Paradox
- Defender of political absolutism (sovereignty with monopoly of power)
- Yet also advocated:
  - Fundamental equality of human beings
  - Natural and inalienable rights
  - State as product of covenant/compact
  - Sovereign authority derived from consent of the governed
- Tensions between absolutism and liberal opposition

### Historical Context
- Treaty of Westphalia (1648) ended religious wars
- Established two key principles:
  - Sovereign state as highest authority
  - Ruler's right to determine state religion
- Born 1588, lived during English Civil War
- Left England for France during civil wars
- Returned 1651 when Leviathan was published
- Died 1679 at age 91

### Hobbes vs. Machiavelli
- Hobbes speaks of "sovereign" vs. Machiavelli's "prince"
- Hobbes' method more scientific and analytical
- Emphasis on self-preservation rather than glory
- Focus on laws rather than arms
- Provided legal and institutional framework for modern state

### Hobbes vs. Aristotle
- Rejected Aristotelian paradigm in political science
- Criticized Aristotle's metaphysics, politics, and ethics
- Presented materialistic view of human nature (humans as machines)
- Emphasized negative motivations (avoiding evil) rather than positive goals
- Politics about avoiding death rather than fulfilling human nature
- Blamed Aristotle for civil conflicts of his age

### Hobbes on Art, Science and Politics
- Art creates the "artificial man" of Leviathan/sovereign
- For Aristotle, nature precedes art; for Hobbes, art transforms nature
- Science as highest form of art
- Reason attained through industry and method
- Science allows mastery over nature
- Political science possible because politics is human-made

### The Great Question: Legitimate Authority
- What makes authority possible and legitimate?
- How can autonomous individuals accept common authority?
- Question arises when rules of authority break down

### The State of Nature
- Not a gift of grace or political condition
- A condition of conflict and war
- May be actual warfare or just "known disposition to fight"
- Life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"
- Nature does not unite humans in peace
- Peace requires human art/contrivance

### Hobbes' Methodology
- State of nature as thought experiment
- Derives from physics of motion and rest
- Materialistic psychology of human behavior
- Experimental method influenced by Francis Bacon
- Abstract individuals stripped of social relations

### Terms
- Leviathan - The sovereign state, described as an "artificial man" created to protect people
- Sovereign - The representative authority with monopoly of power within a territory
- State of Nature - The hypothetical condition of humans without government, characterized by war and conflict
- Civil Science - Hobbes' term for political science, which he claimed to have founded
- Absolutism - Political doctrine advocating complete and indivisible sovereign power
- Social Contract - Agreement between individuals to form a government for mutual protection
- Artificial Person - Hobbes' concept of the sovereign as created through human artifice
- Representative Government - Hobbes' doctrine of "indirect government" through a sovereign representative
