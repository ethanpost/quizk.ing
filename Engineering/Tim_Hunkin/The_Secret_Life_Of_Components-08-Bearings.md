## Bearings Overview

### Primitive Bearings
- Wood bearings used in ancient times
- Shoe box and sellotape constructions
- Wood gets hot with friction

### Historical Materials
- Lignum vitae (16th century onwards)
- Three times harder than oak
- Used for ship propeller shafts until 1960s
- American nuclear submarines used lignum vitae bearings
- Brass bearings (middle ages)
- Used in Victorian engineering and clocks
- Steel shafts running in brass plates

### Modern Materials
- Delrin (acetyl) - hard plastic
- Machines smoothly with drill bits
- Use 0.1mm increments for shaft clearance
- Tufnol - brown plastic with cloth layers
- Very rigid and hard wearing
- Steel bearings for prototypes and intermittent use

### Lubrication
- Oil reduces friction significantly (10x or more)
- Solids run almost friction-free in liquids
- Canal boats "legging it" through tunnels
- Lighthouse lens assemblies float in mercury bars
- Too much oil attracts dust and grit

### Bearing Types
- Oilite bushes (sintered bronze impregnated with oil)
- Plastic bushes (wear over time)
- Jewelled bushes (ruby bearings in watches)
- Ball races (rolling friction vs sliding friction)
- Roller bearings (increased contact area)
- Linear bearings (sliding and rolling versions)

### Terms
- Bearing - A mechanical component that reduces friction between moving parts
- Lignum vitae - An extremely hard tropical hardwood used historically for bearings
- Oilite - Sintered bronze bush impregnated with oil for self-lubrication
- Ball race - A bearing with balls that roll between inner and outer races
- Roller bearing - A bearing using cylindrical rollers instead of balls
- Linear bearing - A bearing that allows linear motion along a shaft or rail
- Sprag clutch - A one-way roller bearing that only turns in one direction
- Pillow block - A bearing mount that can be bolted to a machine
- Tolerance ring - A device that allows for imprecise hole drilling when mounting bearings
- White metal - The thin metal lining inside car engine big end bearings

## Master Answer Key

**Question 1: D** - Lignum vitae was used for ship propeller shaft bearings until the 1960s, including on American nuclear submarines.

**Question 2: B** - Oil reduces friction by 10 times or more, making solids run almost friction-free in liquids.

**Question 3: A** - Steel bearings are recommended for prototypes and intermittent use because they're quick to make and work surprisingly well.

**Question 4: C** - Delrin's proper name is acetyl, a hard plastic that machines smoothly.

**Question 5: C** - Too much oil attracts dust and grit, creating a grinding paste that damages bearings.

**Question 6: B** - The jewels in watches are actually tiny ruby bearing bushes with holes cut in them.

**Question 7: C** - Rolling friction is much lower than sliding friction, as demonstrated by Tim's experiment with the cast iron block.

**Question 8: C** - The Timken company invented tapered roller bearings to handle sideways loads.

**Question 9: D** - A sprag clutch is a one-way roller bearing that only turns in one direction.

**Question 10: A** - White metal is the thin lining inside car engine big end bearings that can last the lifetime of a car.

**Question 11: C** - Rollers provide increased contact area compared to balls, allowing for higher loads.

**Question 12: C** - A pillow block is a bearing mount that can be bolted to a machine and accommodates misalignment.

**Question 13: D** - Tufnol is made from layers of cloth with resin under high pressure, creating a very rigid plastic.

**Question 14: B** - Ball races have limited contact area between the races and balls, limiting the load they can carry.

**Question 15: C** - Tolerance rings allow for imprecise hole drilling when mounting bearings, providing flexibility in manufacturing.

**Question 16: D** - "Legging it" comes from canal boat crews pushing boats through tunnels with their legs.

**Question 17: C** - Bushes are better for heavy loads because they have more contact area than ball races.

**Question 18: C** - Linear bearings allow linear motion along a shaft or rail, unlike rotary bearings.

**Question 19: B** - Dirt gets embedded in the bush material, creating hard bits that wear away at the shaft.

**Question 20: C** - The main problem was side loads on bearings from enthusiastic users, which Tim solved by spacing the bearings further apart.
