### Aristotle's Discovery of America
- Aristotle anticipated key principles of American constitutional design
- The mixed regime (polity) as a solution to the problem of faction
- Balance between oligarchy and democracy prevents dominance by extremes
- Middle class serves as moderating force between competing classes
- Similarities to Madison's Federalist No. 10 on controlling factions
- Points of difference between Aristotle's mixed regime and American system:
  - Aristotle focused on balance of classes rather than separation of functions
  - American system prioritizes individual liberty; Aristotle prioritized city's well-being

### Property and Commerce in a Republic
- Criticizes Plato's excessive unity and common ownership in Republic
- City requires diversity rather than excessive unity
- Private property receives better care than common property
- Commerce and property important but not the ultimate aim of politics
- Politics exists for "noble acts performed well"
- Virtue is primary; wealth exists to support virtue

### The Aristocratic Republic as Best Regime
- Purpose is peace rather than war (critique of Sparta)
- Leisure serves education/philosophy, not mere relaxation
- Ideal citizen is the megalopsychos (great-souled person/gentleman)
- Distinguished by practical wisdom rather than philosophical speculation
- Gentleman possesses inherited wealth but lives in urban setting
- Distinguished by lofty detachment, honesty, aesthetic sense

### Aristotle's Political Science
- Politics as the "master science" that organizes all other disciplines
- Studies the regime (politea) as fundamental ordering principle of society
- Humans as political animals capable of discussing justice
- Knowledge aimed at action (praxis) rather than theory
- Goal is to serve the regime, making it better or preventing decline
- Educates for statecraft and practical judgment (phronimos)

### Method of Aristotle's Political Science
- Rejects rigid methodology in favor of flexibility appropriate to subject
- Four key questions for political scientists:
  - Understanding the best regime under ideal circumstances
  - Identifying best regimes under less-than-ideal conditions
  - How to make any regime more stable
  - Techniques for reform to bring regimes closer to ideal
- Uses ordinary language rather than technical jargon
- Addresses citizens and statesmen, not other political scientists
- Explicitly evaluative rather than falsely "neutral"

### Terms
