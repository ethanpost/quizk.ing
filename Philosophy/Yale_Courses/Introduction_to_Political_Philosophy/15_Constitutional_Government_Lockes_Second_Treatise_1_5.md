## Constitutional Government and Locke's Theory of Natural Law

### Locke's Historical Context and Influence
- Authored Second Treatise, a small book with world-shaping effects
- Became an "honorary founding father" of America
- His ideas were adopted by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence
- Lived during intense religious and political conflict in England
- Younger contemporary of Hobbes
- Exiled to Holland in 1683 before returning to England
- Died in 1704

### Locke's Key Political Principles
- Natural liberty and equality of human beings
- Natural rights to life, liberty, and property ("estate")
- Government by consent
- Limited government with separation of powers
- Right to revolution when government becomes repressive
- Religious toleration
- Definitive expression of constitutional democracy

### Relationship to Previous Political Thought
- Built upon Machiavelli's ideas
- Modified Hobbes' theory of sovereignty and social contract
- Sought to "domesticate" Hobbes' harsh theory of absolute government
- Transformed Hobbes' fierce doctrine into liberal constitutionalism

## Locke's Theory of Natural Law

### The State of Nature
- A condition of perfect freedom without civil authority
- Not primarily historical but a thought experiment
- Unlike Hobbes, Locke sees it as a moral condition
- Governed by natural law that "willeth the peace and preservation of all mankind"
- Natural law dictates that no one should harm another in their life, liberty, or possessions
- Humans as "workmanship of one omnipotent and infinitely wise maker"
- Combines Stoic tradition with Christian ideas

### Ambiguity in Locke's Natural Law Theory
- Shifts between language of moral duty and natural rights
- Natural law sometimes appears as obligation to others
- Other times appears as right to self-preservation
- Without civil authority, state of nature degenerates into conflict
- Each person becomes "judge, jury, and executioner"
- Uses animal imagery ("beasts of prey") suggesting Hobbesian elements
- Debate over whether Locke is traditional or modern in his conception

### Theological Foundations
- Relies on concept of divine workmanship
- Question of whether equality depends on religious argument
- Sparse explicit theological references in the Second Treatise
- Ongoing debate about religious vs. secular foundations of Lockean principles
- Implications for American founding documents and contemporary debates

## Property, Labor and Natural Law

### Locke's Theory of Property (Chapter 5)
- Humans as property-acquiring animals
- Property claims derive from our work and labor
- Labor confers value and is the source of all values
- State of nature begins as condition of communal ownership
- Private property emerges through mixing labor with natural resources
- "Every man has property in his person"
- Natural law dictates a right to private property

### Economic Implications
- World created to be cultivated and improved
- Given to "the industrious and rational"
- Foreshadows a commercial state/republic
- No natural limits to property acquisition
- Introduction of money enables unlimited capital accumulation
- Labor increases value of nature (ten, hundred, or thousand-fold)
- By enriching ourselves, we unintentionally benefit others
- Creates "commonwealth" through emancipation of labor

### Shift from Ancient Political Theory
- Reverses ancient subordination of commerce to politics
- Gives commerce and acquisitiveness moral status
- Politics becomes "sober" and "pedestrian" rather than focused on glory or honor
- Promotes idea that commerce softens manners and civilizes
- Government's task is to protect both property rights and acquisition rights

### Terms
- Second Treatise - Locke's most influential work on political philosophy that outlines his theory of constitutional government
- Natural Law - A moral law discoverable by reason that dictates peace and preservation of mankind
- State of Nature - A pre-political condition of perfect freedom governed by natural law
- Divine Workmanship - Locke's concept that humans are created by God, giving them inherent dignity and equality
- Natural Rights - Inherent, inalienable claims to life, liberty, and property
- Labor Theory of Value - The idea that labor creates and determines the value of property
- Social Contract - An agreement to form government to protect natural rights
- Limited Government - A state whose power is restricted by law and separation of powers
- Right of Revolution - The right of people to overthrow government that violates natural rights
- Commercial Republic - A state that emphasizes commerce and property acquisition as central to political life
