### Purpose of Drainage Systems
- Remove water that flows beneath ground surface
- Prevent pressure that can lift and move structures
- Protect structures from water damage
- Enable soil to drain quickly
- Prevent expansion/contraction of soils

### Historical Context
- Named after Henry French (American farmer/inventor)
- Published book "Farm Drainage" in 1846
- Documented drainage practices used worldwide
- Originally used for agricultural purposes
- Kept fields from becoming waterlogged

### Design Components
- Gravel-filled trenches
- Perforated/slotted pipes
- Clay tiles (historical method)
- Filter materials to prevent clogging
- Outlet systems (gravity or pumped)

### Filtration Methods
- Geotextile fabric
  - Permeable sheets that filter soil particles
  - Prone to damage during installation
  - Difficult to repair once installed
  - Can become clogged over time
- Sand filters
  - Used in critical applications like dams
  - Hold back smaller particles while allowing water through
  - Often used in multi-stage filter designs

### Common Problems
- Clogging is the biggest issue
- Soil particles migrating into the drain
- Internal erosion causing sinkholes
- Water pressure damage to structures
- Improper filter design

### Applications
- Residential foundations and basements
- Agricultural fields
- Dam structures
- Retaining walls
- Spillways

### Terms
- French Drain - A subsurface drainage system consisting of a trench filled with gravel and often containing a perforated pipe to redirect water away from an area
- Internal Erosion - Process where water flowing through soil carries away particles, potentially creating voids or sinkholes
- Geotextile - Permeable fabric used to separate soil layers while allowing water to pass through
- Grain Size Distribution - A graph showing the percentage of soil particles at different sizes, used to design appropriate filters
- Sump Pump - A pump installed in a low collection point to move accumulated drainage water outside a structure
- Chimney Filter - A large internal drain in embankment dams that prevents water from carrying soil particles through cracks
- Perforated Pipe - Pipe with holes or slots that allows water to enter while transporting it away
- Gradation - The distribution of particle sizes in a soil sample
