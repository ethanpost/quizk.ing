## [The Dawn of Energy Abundance | Too Cheap to Meter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfApATdLnoI)

### Energy Fundamentals
- Energy is not matter (E=mcÂ²)
- Fundamental cost of the universe
- Required input for all materials and processes
- Direct correlation with prosperity and quality of life
- Historically tracked with GDP and human development index

### Historical Energy Evolution
- Fire mastery marked human civilization's start
- Agricultural Revolution: Crops as solar panels
- Coal Era
  - Dense fuel source unlocking industrial growth
  - Enabled steam engines and industrialization
  - Cornish miners pioneered early mining techniques
- Oil Age
  - Transformed transportation and materials (plastics)
  - Enabled portable energy storage
  - Standard Oil's innovations in refining

### Modern Energy Sources
- Solar Power
  - Direct photovoltaic conversion
  - Significant cost reductions
  - Deployment challenges and grid integration
- Nuclear Fission
  - Manhattan Project origins
  - Early rapid development (1938-1942)
  - Regulatory challenges post-Three Mile Island
- Nuclear Fusion
  - Recent breakthroughs at NIF
  - Multiple competing approaches (tokamak, inertial confinement)
  - Commercial viability challenges

### Future Energy Landscape
- Energy Abundance vs Conservation
