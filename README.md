# quizk.ing üìö‚ú®

Welcome to **quizk.ing** ‚Äì a collection of learning content for everyone!

This repository stores educational material sourced primarily from video transcripts and other learning documents. The content is designed to be accessible and engaging, making it a great tool for personal study or family/classroom learning.

**3/21/2025: This project is in Beta mode! This means I have made major design changes within that past 30 days.**

New content is being added all the time and generated using tools like ChatGPT. Quizzes are in a format called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and most appropriate for the importing into [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/). If you don't want to use Mochi (there is a free plan), you can use ChatGPT to proxy a quiz and assist in answering more detailed questions by pasting the quiz into chat. 

## üìÑ What's Inside

- `.md` files: Markdown files containing [question-and-answer style content](https://mochi.cards/docs/#cards). These files are formatted for easy import into the [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/) flashcard app.

## üöÄ Purpose

I created this repository to:

- Enhance my own personal learning.
- Assign specific decks to my children to support their education.
- Share useful, bite-sized learning resources with anyone interested.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Download any `.md` file from this repo.
2. Open [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/).
3. Import the file and start reviewing flashcards!

> You can also just link to the "Raw" version of the file from the Mochi import dialog.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note for Importing `.md` Files into Mochi
When importing `.md` files:
- Make sure to specify that there is **more than one question per file**.
- Use `///` as the **separator string** to properly divide each flashcard.

This ensures that all flashcards are imported correctly and organized for easy study.

## Basic Requirements

The following items are either required, strongly recommended, or useful for this project. You could replace Notion.so with any number of other note taking applications. Email, typing, and Mochi are "required".

### Email (needed to sign up for services)

Students or parents require an email account to sign up for services like Notion, Mochi, etc. It is best if there is one email per student, wether managed by the parent or the student. I have used Gmail and Outlook accounts for this. 

### Typing (everyone needs to be able to type)

My students are required to learn to type at an age appropriate speed. I'am having them try [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/) for this. Speed should improve with practice and be verified by the parent/teacher.

### Mochi is a Flash Card review application

Mochi is a spaced repition learning tool. Students download quiz/outline content to [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/) using the free version. My students are using the free account tier.

### Notion for sharing progress with parents/students

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is a note taking application students can use for a variety of purposes. My intent is to have each student document thier own progress and share it with the parent/teacher or even classmates when appropriate. My students are using the free account tier.

## üå± Contributions & Feedback

Right now, this is a personal project, but I'm always open to ideas, improvements, or collaborations in the future.
