### History and Origins
- Gunpowder originated in China around 900 AD
- Ancient Chinese recipe combined sulfur, saltpeter (potassium nitrate), and honey
- Breakthrough came when honey was replaced with charcoal
- Gunpowder became the foundation for fireworks and explosives

### Chemistry of Gunpowder
- Three key ingredients:
  - Potassium nitrate (saltpeter) - provides concentrated oxygen
  - Charcoal - primarily carbon, provides fuel
  - Sulfur - has low melting point, helps combustion
- Optimal proportions: 75% potassium nitrate, 15% charcoal, 10% sulfur
- Produces smoke when burned (solid reaction products)

### Chemical Reactions and Rate
- Reaction rate increases with:
  - Higher temperature
  - Greater density/concentration
  - Better mixing of ingredients
- Thermal runaway: confined reactions increase temperature and density
- Confinement dramatically increases reaction speed

### Flash Powder
- Developed for early photography to produce bright light
- Contains metals (magnesium, aluminum) and oxidizers (potassium perchlorate)
- Burns much faster than gunpowder when confined
- Used to create bangs in modern fireworks

### Colors in Fireworks
- Different metals produce different colors:
  - Strontium - red
  - Calcium - orange
  - Sodium - yellow
  - Barium - green
  - Copper - blue
  - Magnesium/Aluminum/Titanium - white
  - Strontium + Copper - purple

### Firework Construction
- Shells are the most important fireworks for professional displays
- Components of a shell:
  - Fuse - conducts flame into the shell
  - Lifting charge (gunpowder) - propels shell into sky
  - Delay fuse - creates timed delay
  - Bursting charge - explodes shell at highest point
  - Stars - produce visual effects (colors, etc.)

### Fuses and Ignition Systems
- Black match - string coated in gunpowder (primitive)
- Quick match - black match in a paper tube (faster burning)
- Visco - tube containing compressed gunpowder
- Plastic igniter cord (PIC) - waterproof fuse
- Electric igniters - modern method for professional displays

### Special Effects
- Crackle - thousands of small explosions
- Strobing - twinkling lights that flash on and off
- Whistling - sound produced by burning composition in a tube

### Smokeless Pyrotechnics
- Nitrocellulose discovered accidentally by Christian Friedrich Schönbein
- Created by treating cotton with nitric and sulfuric acids
- Burns without smoke (produces only invisible gases)
- Can be combined with color-producing chemicals

### Firework Categories
- Category 1: Indoor fireworks
- Category 2: Garden fireworks (5-meter safety distance)
- Category 3: Display fireworks (25-meter safety distance)
- Category 4: Professional fireworks (not available to public)

### Terms
- Gunpowder/Black powder - Explosive mixture of potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur
- Potassium nitrate - Chemical compound that serves as an oxidizer in fireworks
- Oxidizer - Substance that provides concentrated oxygen for combustion
- Charcoal - Carbon-based fuel made by heating wood in the absence of air
- Thermal runaway - Process where increasing temperature accelerates reaction rate
- Flash powder - Fast-burning mixture of metals and oxidizers used for bangs
- Shell - Type of firework shot from a mortar tube that explodes in the air
- Mortar - Tube used to launch firework shells
- Lifting charge - Gunpowder at the base of a shell that propels it upward
- Bursting charge - Explosive that breaks apart the shell at its highest point
- Stars - Compressed pyrotechnic mixtures that produce visual effects
- Nitrocellulose - Smokeless explosive made by treating cotton with acids
- Visco - Modern safety fuse containing compressed gunpowder
- Plastic igniter cord (PIC) - Waterproof fuse with pyrotechnic core
- Electric igniter - Device that produces flame when electrical current is applied
