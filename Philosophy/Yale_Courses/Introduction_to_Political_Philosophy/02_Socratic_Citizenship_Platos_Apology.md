### Political Context
- Trial of Socrates occurred in 399 BCE
- Followed the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta
- Athens had recently suffered military defeat (404 BCE)
- Pro-Spartan oligarchy (Thirty Tyrants) ruled Athens for a year (404-403 BCE)
- Democracy was restored in 403 BCE
- Socrates was 70 years old at his trial
- His accusers (Anytus, Meletus, Lycos) were part of the democratic resistance movement

### The Charges Against Socrates
- Two sets of accusations:
  - Current charges by Anytus and Meletus: corrupting the youth and impiety toward the gods
  - Earlier accusations from "earlier accusers" (including Aristophanes)
- Aristophanes portrayed Socrates in his play "Clouds" (423 BCE) as:
  - Investigating "things aloft and things under the earth"
  - Making "the weaker argument the stronger"
  - Running a "think tank" (Phrontisterion)
  - Teaching dangerous ideas that undermine social norms

### The Socratic Turn
- Socrates recounts story of the Delphic Oracle declaring no one wiser than him
- This began his lifelong quest to find someone wiser than himself
- Marks transition from investigating natural phenomena to studying human/political questions
- This "second sailing" established Socrates as founder of political science

### Socrates' New Model of Citizenship
- Socrates promotes a new kind of citizen focused on:
  - Rational argument rather than poetic inspiration
  - Dialectical questioning instead of storytelling
  - Self-examination and pursuit of knowledge
  - Care for one's soul rather than material goods or political power
- Claims "the unexamined life is not worth living"
- Believes pursuit of justice requires private rather than public life

### Philosophy vs. The City
- Philosophy and the city stand in tension with one another
- Every society operates within medium of belief/faith
- Philosophy seeks to replace opinion with knowledge
- Creates inevitable conflict between philosophical questioning and civic piety
- Socrates challenges Athens by putting democracy itself on trial
- Fundamental question: who has the right to educate future citizens?

### Terms
- Dáº½mos - Greek word for "the people"
- Phrontisterion - "Thinkery" or "think tank"; what Aristophanes called Socrates' school
- Impiety - Disrespect toward things society cares deeply about; religious offense
- Examined life - Life of continuous questioning and self-improvement
- Periclean Athens - Athens at the height of its cultural and political power under Pericles
- Dialectical - Conversational, argumentative method of seeking truth
- Aristophanic Socrates - Earlier portrayal of Socrates as a natural philosopher studying physical phenomena
- Platonic Socrates - Later portrayal focused on moral and political questions
- Thirty Tyrants - Pro-Spartan oligarchy that ruled Athens for a year (404-403 BCE)
