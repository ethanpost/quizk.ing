## Introduction to Automation
- Automation provides "superpower" capabilities for makers
- Relays and contactors are fundamental automation components
- Automation allows one switch to control multiple other switches
- Example: Automated dust collection system eliminates manual switching

## DC Power Supplies
- Essential first tool in automation toolbox
- Converts mains power (120-240V AC) to appropriate DC voltage
- Two main categories: Industrial and hobby/DIY level
- Industrial power supplies:
  - Mount using DIN rail brackets
  - More durable and long-lasting
  - Usually 24V, though other voltages available
  - More expensive than hobby versions
- Hobby/DIY power supplies:
  - Mount with screw holes
  - Smaller and more affordable
  - Can be as small as wall adapters
- Voltage selection considerations:
  - Match voltage to components (e.g., Raspberry Pi needs 5V)
  - Multi-voltage supplies available (e.g., 5V and 12V outputs)
- Current capacity important:
  - Must handle total current of all connected devices
  - Larger power supplies needed for more power
  - Ventilation required for heat dissipation
- Input voltage switching:
  - Some supplies have manual switches for 115V/230V
  - Wide range supplies (120-240V) work automatically
- Polarity identification:
  - Usually labeled on power supply
  - Wall adapters may not be labeled
  - Test with multimeter to verify positive/negative

## Relays and Contactors
- Most important electrical tool in automation toolbox
- Relay and contactor are essentially the same device
- Contactor is "big brother" of relay for high-power applications
- Four main benefits:
  1. No physical movement required - electrically controlled
  2. One switch controls many switches
  3. Sensors can trigger relays
  4. Low-power circuit controls high-power circuit
- Applications:
  - Computerized control systems
  - Thermostat operation
  - Dust collection automation
  - Central control panels
- Relay operation:
  - Normal position: coil off
  - Activated position: coil energized
  - Normally Closed (NC): connected when coil off
  - Normally Open (NO): connected when coil on
- Relay specifications:
  - Poles: number of switching contacts
  - Throw: single or double (switches between contacts)
  - Examples: 2-pole double throw, 4-pole single throw
- Wiring considerations:
  - Small control cables vs. large power cables
  - Place contactor near controlled device
  - Use small cables for control signals

## Proximity Sensors
- Detect presence of metal without physical contact
- Advantages over limit switches:
  - No physical contact required
  - Won't be damaged by overrun
  - More reliable for fast-moving machines
- Sensing distance varies by material:
  - Steel: good sensing distance
  - Aluminum: requires much closer proximity
- Wiring:
  - Brown wire: positive
  - Black wire: signal (NPN) or positive (PNP)
  - Blue wire: negative
- Specifications:
  - Supply voltage: 6-36V
  - Load current: typically 300mA maximum
- Applications:
  - CNC machine limit detection
  - Presence detection
  - Position sensing

## Limit Switches
- Physical switches activated by contact
- Two distinct positions:
  - Engage point: when switch activates
  - Release point: when switch deactivates
- Hysteresis: difference between engage and release points
- Applications:
  - End-of-travel detection
  - Home position sensing
  - Safety interlocks
- Configurations:
  - Rocker arm style
  - Push button style
  - Roller configurations (inline or 90Â°)
- Wiring: Can be normally open or normally closed

## Reed Switches
- Very small magnetic switches
- Activated by proximity of magnet
- Low current capacity
- Applications:
  - Magnetic door sensors
  - Position detection with magnets
  - Low-power switching applications

## Additional Sensor Types
- Temperature sensors:
  - Open/close circuit at threshold
  - Digital versions provide real-time feedback
  - Applications: thermal protection, process control
- Pressure sensors:
  - Detect pressure in chambers
  - Digital displays available
  - Applications: pneumatic systems, safety monitoring

## Breakout Boards
- Convert microelectronics pins to screw terminals
- Available for Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and other microcontrollers
- DIN rail mounting options
- Benefits:
  - No soldering required
  - Easy connections
  - Durable and reliable
  - Easy component swapping
