### Overview and Purpose
- Construction began in 1931, completed ahead of schedule in 1936
- Goals included controlling flooding, managing sediment, storing water, and creating predictable river flow
- Electricity generation was a secondary goal but eventually paid for the entire cost
- Provides irrigation water for 2 million acres and municipal water for urban centers
- Generates enough hydroelectric power for 1.3 million people annually

### Dam Design and Dimensions
- Arch-gravity design combining two dam types for maximum strength
- 727 feet high from foundation to crest
- 660 feet thick at base, tapering to 50 feet at top
- Used 3,250,000 cubic yards of concrete for the dam itself
- Created Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States (9.2 trillion gallons)

### Construction Process
#### Site Preparation
- Four massive diversion tunnels built to redirect river flow (56 feet diameter, 3/4 mile long)
- Cofferdams built to hold back water during construction
- Excavation of 6 million cubic yards of material
- Abutments prepared with high-scalers cleaning canyon walls

#### Concrete Placement
- Concrete mixed on-site at specialized plants
- Poured in 5-foot lifts (sections) with interlocking columns
- Special cooling system using embedded pipes to manage heat of hydration
- Joints grouted to create a solid monolithic structure
- Cableways used to transport concrete and equipment across the canyon

### Internal Systems
- Network of internal galleries for inspection, drainage, and grouting
- Grout curtain created under dam to prevent water seepage
- Elevator shafts, stairways, and access corridors throughout structure

### Water Management System
#### Intake Towers
- Concrete towers with trash racks to filter debris
- Two intake levels per tower to accommodate different reservoir depths
- Gates that can be opened or closed to control water flow

#### Penstocks
- 30-foot diameter steel pipes that carry water from intakes to generators
- Built on-site due to massive size
- Connected to original diversion tunnels through concrete plugs

#### Power Generation
- Turbines rated at 115,000 horsepower each
- Water flows through spiral cases to drive turbine wheels
- Generators create electricity, which is transformed and distributed

#### Outlet Works
- Valve houses built into canyon walls
- Needle valves control water flow through system
- Tunnel plug outlet works with 12 additional valves

#### Spillways
- Two massive spillways, one on each side of the canyon
- Combined capacity of 400,000 cubic feet of water per second
- Drum gates can be raised or lowered to control reservoir level

### Terms
- Adit - A horizontal passage from the surface into a mine or tunnel, open at only one end
- Arch-gravity dam - A dam design combining arch and gravity dam principles for maximum strength
- Abutment - Areas where the sides of the dam interface with canyon walls
- Cofferdam - A temporary dam built to hold back water during construction
- Diversion tunnel - A tunnel built to redirect river flow during dam construction
- Gallery - An internal passageway inside the dam for inspection and maintenance
- Grout curtain - A barrier created by injecting grout into rock to prevent water seepage
- Heat of hydration - Heat generated as concrete cures that can cause cracking
- High-scaler - Worker who cleaned canyon walls while suspended by ropes
- Intake tower - Structure that takes in water from the reservoir
- Keyway - Corrugations in concrete forms that lock blocks together
- Penstock - A large pipe that carries water from intakes to turbines
- Spillway - A structure that allows controlled release of water from a dam
- Trash rack - Metal grate that filters debris from water entering intakes
- Valve house - Structure containing valves that control water flow
