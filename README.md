# quizk.ing üìö‚ú®

Welcome to **quizk.ing** ‚Äì a collection of learning content for everyone!

This repository stores educational material sourced primarily from video transcripts and other learning documents. The content is designed to be accessible and engaging, making it a great tool for personal study or family/classroom learning.

**3/21/2025: This project is in Beta mode! This means I have made major design changes within that past 30 days.**

New content is being added all the time and generated using tools like ChatGPT. Quizzes are in a format called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and most appropriate for the importing into [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/). If you don't want to use Mochi (there is a free plan), you can use ChatGPT to proxy a quiz and assist in answering more detailed questions by pasting the quiz into chat. 

## üìÑ What's Inside

- `.md` files: Markdown files containing [question-and-answer style content](https://mochi.cards/docs/#cards). These files are formatted for easy import into the [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/) flashcard app.

## üöÄ Purpose

I created this repository to:

- Enhance my own personal learning.
- Assign specific decks to my children to support their education.
- Share useful, bite-sized learning resources with anyone interested.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Download any `.md` file from this repo.
2. Open [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/).
3. Import the file and start reviewing flashcards!

> You can also just link to the "Raw" version of the file from the Mochi import dialog.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note for Importing `.md` Files into Mochi
When importing `.md` files:
- Make sure to specify that there is **more than one question per file**.
- Use `///` as the **separator string** to properly divide each flashcard.

This ensures that all flashcards are imported correctly and organized for easy study.

## üå± Contributions & Feedback

Right now, this is a personal project, but I'm always open to ideas, improvements, or collaborations in the future.
