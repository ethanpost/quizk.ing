### Introduction and Context
- Gavin Ortlund's response to Craig Truglia's arguments about icon veneration
- Two main reasons for engagement: relationship building and truth-seeking
- Aim for irenic dialogue following James 3:17
- Address concerns about misrepresenting scholarship

### Scholarship and Methodology
- Gavin's position represents mainstream scholarly consensus
- Gap between academic scholarship and popular apologetics awareness
- Richard Price's statement about iconoclast claims being correct
- Standard view: icon veneration emerged in 6th-7th centuries
- Not an argument from authority but presentation of evidence

### Five Data Points Analysis

#### 1. Origen
- Thoroughly opposed to cultic use of images
- Clear distinction between pagan and Christian worship
- Contra Celsum 8:20 - "statues, altars, and temples" are metaphors
- Christian "statues" = virtues, not literal images
- Christian "altars" = prayers from pure conscience
- Christian "temples" = the body

#### 2. Eusebius
- Church History 7:18 - describes images but not veneration
- Attributes practice to pagan holdover ("habit of the Gentiles")
- Eusebius condemns image-making in response to Constantia
- Methodological problem: using condemnation as evidence
- Condemnation based on pagan associations, not Christian practice

#### 3. Tertullian
- "Thunderingly against images"
- On Idolatry chapter 5 - addresses artificers (idol-makers)
- Opposition from people quoting scripture (bronze serpent)
- Not evidence of icon veneration in worship
- Spectrum of aniconism - opposition to extreme doesn't mean iconophilia

#### 4. Grotto in Nazareth Inscription
- Fragmentary Greek inscription on column
- Multiple possible translations and interpretations
- Date uncertain (not firmly established as 2nd-3rd century)
- Bigham acknowledges it's only a "supposition"
- Very ambiguous and fragmentary data

#### 5. Epiphanius
- Late 4th century - fits Phase 2 timeline
- Condemns image veneration but claims "nobody's ever done this before"
- No awareness of Incarnation changing Second Commandment
- No distinction between veneration and worship
- Suggests innovation being warned against, not established practice

### Methodological Concerns
- Problem of using condemnation as positive evidence
- Condemnation based on pagan associations
- Cannot assume opposition to extreme aniconism equals iconophilia
- Spectrum fallacy in argumentation

### Oriental Orthodox Question
- Formal division doesn't preclude common development
- Cultural and historical proximity explains similarities
- Idolatry as perennial temptation across traditions

### Terms

- **Didactic Purpose** - Using images for teaching and educational purposes rather than worship.
- **Development of Doctrine** - The theological concept that Christian teachings can develop and evolve over time while remaining faithful to apostolic tradition.
- **Irenic Dialogue** - Peaceful and respectful theological discussion aimed at understanding rather than conflict.
- **Apologetics** - The defense and explanation of religious beliefs through reasoned argument.
- **Scholarly Consensus** - The generally accepted view among academic experts in a particular field of study.
