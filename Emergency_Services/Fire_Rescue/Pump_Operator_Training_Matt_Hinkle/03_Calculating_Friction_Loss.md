### Friction Loss Formula Components
- Basic Formula: FL = C * Q² * L
  - C = Coefficient of friction (based on hose size)
  - Q = Quantity of water (in hundreds of GPM)
  - L = Length of hose (in hundreds of feet)

### Formula Variations
- Q/100² instead of Q² for easier calculation
- L/100 instead of L for length in hundreds of feet
- Important to keep square outside parentheses for Q/100

### Calculation Process
- Three required components:
  - Hose size (for coefficient)
  - Water flow rate (GPM)
  - Hose length (feet)
- Use coefficient table for different hose sizes
- Convert measurements to hundreds
  - 200 feet = 2 (L/100)
  - 150 GPM = 1.5 (Q/100)

### Example Scenarios
- Basic calculation: 200ft of 1¾" hose @ 150 GPM
- Smooth bore nozzle: 200ft of 1¾" hose with 1" tip
- Relay operations: 400ft of 4" hose @ 500 GPM

### Terms
- Friction Loss (FL) - The loss of water pressure due to resistance in fire hose
- Coefficient of Friction (C) - A number based on hose size that represents resistance
- GPM - Gallons Per Minute
- Smooth Bore Tip - A solid stream nozzle with a fixed opening size
- LDH - Large Diameter Hose
- PSI - Pounds per Square Inch
- Relay Operations - Moving water from one apparatus to another
