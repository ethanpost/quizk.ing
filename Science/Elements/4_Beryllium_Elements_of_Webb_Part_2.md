### Location and Mining
- Mined near Delta, Utah, south of Salt Lake City
- Utah is home to many valuable materials (copper, magnesium, uranium, gold, silver)
- 90% of the world's beryllium was mined from this deposit
- Beryllium is found in volcanic ash dust
- Hydrothermally deposited millions of years ago and covered by volcanic rock
- Mining process requires removing volcanic rock to access the ore seam

### Properties and Usage
- Chosen for Webb's mirrors because it is:
  - Lightweight
  - Strong
  - Dimensionally stable (doesn't warp at cold temperatures)
- Webb's mirrors started as 5-foot tall, 5-foot wide, 2-inch-thick blocks of beryllium

### Rarity and Processing
- Highest concentration runs through a 10-foot tall diagonal ribbon below ground
- Ore concentration is only 0.25% beryllium (5 pounds per ton of ore)
- Requires removing 400 feet of rock to access the ore seam
- Approximately 4 tons of rock processed for every pound of beryllium
- Processing converts ore to pure beryllium powder
- Powder is pressed into blocks ready for machining

### Terms
- Beryllium - A lightweight, strong, and dimensionally stable metal used for the James Webb Space Telescope mirrors
- Ore Seam - The layer of rock containing the beryllium ore
- Hydrothermally Deposited - Mineral deposits formed by hot water solutions moving through rock
- Dimensionally Stable - A property where a material maintains its shape and doesn't warp under temperature changes
- Ore Concentration - The percentage of valuable mineral within mined rock (0.25% for beryllium)
