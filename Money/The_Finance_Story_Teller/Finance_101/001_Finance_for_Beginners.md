### Finance Idea #1: Profit vs Cash Flow
- Profit is not necessarily the same as cash flow
- Example of an inventor who outsources manufacturing and selling
  - Pays supplier cash on delivery
  - Receives payment from retailer after 30 days
  - For 100 units purchased at $80 each and 50 units sold at $100 each:
    - Profit: $1000 ($20 margin per unit Ã— 50 units)
    - Cash flow: -$8000 (paid supplier, not yet paid by retailer)
- Profit recognition occurs when goods are delivered to customer
- Cash flow recognition occurs when cash moves in or out
- A business can be profitable yet go bankrupt due to negative cash flow

### Finance Idea #2: Financial Statements
- Each financial statement tells a unique story
- Balance sheet
  - Overview of assets, liabilities, and equity
  - Shows what is owned (left) and owed (right)
  - A snapshot at a specific point in time (month-end, quarter-end, year-end)
- Income statement
  - Shows how revenue minus expenses equals profit/loss
  - Described as a "movie" of profitability during a period
- Cash flow statement
  - Shows movement from initial cash balance through inflows/outflows to ending balance
  - A "documentary movie" about changes in the cash account

### Finance Idea #3: Book Value vs Market Value
- Book value (accounting value) is not necessarily the same as market value
- Example of Apple Inc. (2019)
  - Book value: $106 billion (equity on balance sheet)
  - Book value per share: $22.55 (based on 4.7 billion outstanding shares)
  - Market value per share: approximately $200
- Book value looks backward at historical financial results
- Market value looks forward based on investor expectations for the future

### Finance Idea #4: Driving Operating Income
- Multiple approaches beyond simple cost-cutting
- Price optimization
  - Ensuring prices reflect the value created for customers
- Volume increase
  - Finding opportunities to sell more units
- Product/service mix improvement
  - Focusing resources on higher margin offerings
- Productivity enhancement
  - Generating same output with fewer resources or more output with same resources
- Sourcing benefits
  - Renegotiating with suppliers or finding better alternatives
- Strategic spending increases
  - Research and development for better products/services
  - Marketing to build brand
  - Learning and development to improve employee skills

### Finance Idea #5: Time Value of Money
- Money today is worth more than the same amount in the future
- Reasons for preference of immediate payment:
  - Risk of non-payment
  - Risk of payor bankruptcy
  - Inflation reducing purchasing power
- Present value can be calculated (e.g., $100 today equals $105 in one year)
- Key concept in evaluating investments using:
  - Net Present Value (NPV)
  - Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

### Terms
- Profit - Revenue minus expenses; recognized when goods are delivered to customer
- Cash Flow - Movement of money into or out of a business; recognized when cash physically moves
- Balance Sheet - Financial statement showing assets, liabilities, and equity at a point in time
- Income Statement - Financial statement showing revenue, expenses, and resulting profit/loss over a period
- Cash Flow Statement - Financial statement showing cash inflows and outflows over a period
- Book Value - Worth of a company based on its balance sheet and historical financial results
- Market Value - Worth of a company based on investor expectations and what people are willing to pay
- Operating Income - Profit from a company's core business operations
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) - Direct costs attributable to the production of goods sold
- Time Value of Money - Concept that money available now is worth more than the same amount in the future
- Net Present Value (NPV) - Method to calculate the current value of future cash flows
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR) - Interest rate at which the net present value of all cash flows equals zero
