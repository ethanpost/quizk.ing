## [Simple vs Compound Interest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeekQAP5yDY)

### Introduction to Interest
- Interest is a fee paid for the use of someone else's money
- Compound interest is great to earn but should be avoided when paying
- Credit card debt example with 20% annual interest rate

### Simple Interest
- Simple interest means only paying the interest charged without reducing the principal
- Example with $1000 credit card debt:
  - Annual interest of 20% = $200 per year
  - If only interest is paid each year, principal remains at $1000
  - After 5 years, $1000 in total interest paid (5 Ã— $200)
  - Principal amount remains unchanged at $1000

### Compound Interest (When Paying)
- Occurs when interest charged is added to the outstanding debt balance
- Example with $1000 credit card debt at 20% annual interest:
  - Year 1: $1000 + $200 interest = $1200
  - Year 2: $1200 + $240 interest = $1440
  - Year 3: $1440 + $288 interest = $1728
  - Year 4: $1728 + $346 interest = $2074
  - Year 5: $2074 + $414 interest = $2488
- After 5 years, $1488 in total interest accumulated
- Original $1000 debt becomes $2488

### Compound Interest (When Earning)
- Same principle applies to investments
- Example with $1000 investment at 20% annual compound return:
  - Year 1: $1000 + $200 interest = $1200
  - Year 2: $1200 + $240 interest = $1440
  - Year 3: $1440 + $288 interest = $1728
  - Year 4: $1728 + $346 interest = $2074
  - Year 5: $2074 + $414 interest = $2488
- After 5 years, $1488 in total interest earned
- Original $1000 investment becomes $2488

### Terms
