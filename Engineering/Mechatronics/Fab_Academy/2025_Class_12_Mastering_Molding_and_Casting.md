### Introduction and Context
- Molding and casting is more important industrially than 3D printing
- More versatile process than 3D printing
- Students will make molds and cast parts
- Examples shown: trains, balance bike tires, foosball table, machine controller

### Types of Molding Processes
- Injection molding: heats plastic and injects into mold
- Insert/overmolding: casting around existing parts
- Vacuum molding: heats material and pulls vacuum
- Roto molding: tumbles mold on all axes for smooth shell
- Flexible/soft tooling: primary focus of the class

### Mold Design Principles
- One-sided molds: simplest, single face
- Two-sided molds: more complex
- Multi-sided molds: can go beyond two sides (example: six-sided tesseract mold)
- Registration: parts must align properly
- Nesting: complete face nesting for better positional control
- Parting line placement: strategic placement to minimize visibility
- Fill points and vents: necessary for material entry and air escape

### Materials for Molds
- Low temperature wax: can be softened for impressions
- Rigid wax: can be machined and reused
- Foam: cheap for large volumes, poor surface tolerance
- Alginet: biocompatible material
- Urethane: tough rubbers with fine detail
- Urethane plastics: can be tinted with colors
- Clear rubber: for clear casting
- Epoxies: for rigid clear casting
- Silicones: high resolution casting (down to nanometers)
- Calcium-based compounds (Dry Stone, Hydro Stone): high resolution concrete-like materials
- Low temp alloys: for metal casting

### Casting Materials and Additives
- Base resins with various additives
- Glass spheres: reduce density
- Short fibers: increase tensile strength
- Nickel/carbon: for conductivity
- Quartz: for thermal conductivity
- Elastomers: for rubber concrete combinations

### Mixing and Pouring Process
- Messy process requiring protection (gloves, lab coat, paper covering)
- Clean workspace essential
- Test casts recommended before full mold
- Mixing by shearing, not scooping (prevents air bubbles)
- Equal amounts by volume for most materials
- Stirring takes longer than expected (several minutes)
- Pour in thin bead for better flow and bubble reduction
- Painting fine features with brush for smooth resin layer

### Bubble Prevention Techniques
- Shearing instead of scooping during mixing
- Pouring in thin bead
- Vibrating the mold
- Painting fine features
- Vacuum chamber: pulls air out
- Pressure chamber: forces air in
- Allowing time for bubbles to rise and escape

### Curing Process
- Polymerization reactions and cross-linking
- Calcium materials hydrate
- Balance of endothermic and exothermic reactions
- Most polymers cure faster with warming
- Exothermic reactions release heat
- Deep cure materials cure chemically throughout
- Heat management important for deep sections
- Overheating can melt containers

### Demolding Considerations
- Draft angles needed for rigid molds with rigid parts
- Soft molds allow complex geometries and overhangs
- Release agents needed for sticking materials
- Dilute dish soap as DIY release agent
- Material compatibility affects sticking

### Safety Considerations
- Read safety data sheets for all materials
- Ventilation required for most materials (except silicone, hydro stone, dry stone)
- Some materials marked "not for home use" require fume hoods
- Protective equipment essential
- Proper disposal of unused resins
- Materials must be set/cured before disposal

### Production Methods
- Machining: traditional method with smooth surface finish
- 3D printing: increasingly competitive
- SLA printers: beautiful surface finish
- FDM printers: require post-processing
- Goal: featureless, smooth surface finish

### Assignment Requirements
- Group assignment: review safety data sheets, test materials
- Individual assignment: design mold with smooth surface finish
- Cast parts in different materials
- Extra credit: two-part molds
- Food-safe options available
