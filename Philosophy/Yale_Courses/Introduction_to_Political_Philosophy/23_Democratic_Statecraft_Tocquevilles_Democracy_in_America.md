### Moral and Psychological Features of the Democratic State
- Volume 1 focuses on social and political institutions
- Volume 2 focuses on moral and psychological components of democratic individuals
- Three key psychological aspects:
  - Compassion
  - Restiveness (anxiety/inquietude)
  - Self-interest

#### Compassion
- Democracy makes people gentler toward one another
- Contrast with aristocratic indifference to outsiders
- Democratic equality allows people to identify with others' suffering
- Effects:
  - Reduction in deliberate cruelty and torture
  - Enlarged moral sympathies for distant peoples
  - Risk of becoming soft and morally sensitive
  - Potential for "misplaced compassion" as moral superiority

#### Restiveness/Anxiety (Inquietude)
- Perpetual uneasiness and dissatisfaction
- Connected to desire for material well-being
- Democratic soul always a "work in progress"
- Constant pursuit of happiness that remains elusive
- Tocqueville's description of Americans:
  - Building, selling, and moving constantly
  - Never settling or enjoying fruits of labor
  - "Distracting themselves from their happiness"
  - Similar to Plato's description of democratic soul in Republic

#### Self-Interest Rightly Understood
- Not universal determinant but product of democratic social state
- Different from aristocratic concern with fame and honor
- Promotes peaceful cooperation rather than warlike competition
- Democratic and egalitarian - available to everyone
- Creates individuals who are:
  - Regulated
  - Temperate
  - Moderate
  - Foresighted
  - Masters of themselves

### Democratic Statecraft
- Democracy in America as work of political education
- "A new political science for a world altogether new"
- Tension between historical forces and human agency
- Historical determinism vs. individual initiative
- Tocqueville's views on statecraft:
  - Statesman constrained by geography, social customs, morals
  - Like ship's captain who can direct vessel but not control ocean
  - Yet Tocqueville opposes systems denying human agency
  - Democracy inevitable but its form depends on human will and intelligence

### Tocqueville's Conclusion
- Democratic age is irreversible
- Form democracy takes depends on human agency
- Rejects doctrines of historical determinism as "false and cowardly"
- Politics takes place within language
- Tocqueville provides language to shape democratic future

### Terms
- Compassion - Heightened ability to identify with the suffering of others in democratic societies
- Inquietude - Anxiety or restlessness characteristic of democratic souls
- Self-interest well understood - Doctrine that promotes virtues of moderation and foresight rather than pure egoism
- Democratic revolution - The irreversible historical transition from aristocracy to democracy
- Path dependency - The idea that we are embedded within historical processes that limit our options
- Democratic social state - The condition of equality of conditions that shapes democratic individuals
- Democratic statecraft - The art of governing within democratic constraints while maintaining freedom
- Moral phenomenology - Tocqueville's descriptive approach to democratic character traits
- Providence - Divine guidance that Tocqueville sees directing historical progress
- Political education - Tocqueville's project of guiding statesmen in democratic governance
