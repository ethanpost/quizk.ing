## Conservative Outlook
- Rooted in the past - concerned with who we have been, who we are
- Focus on principles and limits on human behavior
- Limited government as essential
- Views the root cause of social problems as human nature itself
- Society divisions properly seen as "cans vs. cannots", "dos vs. do-nots", "wills vs. will-nots"

## Radical Outlook
- Oriented toward an imaginary future
- Believes in human perfection and unlimited human potential
- Rejects structure, process, and limits
- Contempt for present systems (e.g., elections)
- Views society as rigidly divided between "halves" and "have-nots"
- Follows Marx's view of history as class struggle

## Who Was Saul Alinsky
- Chicago radical who came of age in the 1930s
- Studied sociology at University of Chicago
- Studied the Al Capone mob
- Called Frank Nitti (mob enforcer) his "teacher"
- Anti-communist but also anti-anti-communist (opposed the West)
- Critical of the New Left for being too open about revolutionary aims

## Alinsky's Methods
### Deception
- Don't tell people your real agenda
- Pose as a liberal/moderate to gain trust
- Present radical ideas in reasonable packaging
- "Boring from within" existing systems

### Power as the Goal
- Community organizing is about creating a power base
- The issue is never the issue; the issue is always the revolution
- Focus on destruction rather than creation
- All means justified in pursuit of radical ends

### Politics of Personal Destruction
- Stigmatize and obliterate opponents through character assassination
- Example: advising students to dress as KKK to "support" Bush
- Following Lenin's principle: the object of political debate is "to wipe him from the face of the Earth"

## Modern Examples of Alinskyism
- Barack Obama as Alinsky trainee and practitioner
- Van Jones: "giving up the cheap satisfactions of the radical pose for the deep satisfactions of radical ends"
- ACORN and use of government funding for radical organizing
- Green jobs movement as power-building exercise
- Healthcare reforms as control mechanisms

## Terms
- Community Organizer - An activist trained in Alinsky methods who builds power bases in communities
- Fellow Traveler - A leftist who endorsed revolutionary goals but didn't follow Communist Party discipline
- New Left - The radical left movement of the 1960s that was more open about its revolutionary aims
- Anti-Anti-Communist - Someone who opposed anti-communism while not explicitly supporting communism
- Rules for Radicals - Alinsky's book outlining tactics for community organizers (originally titled "Rules for Revolution")
- Halves vs. Have-Nots - Alinsky's conception of society as divided between oppressors and oppressed
