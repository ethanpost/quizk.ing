### Introduction to Nuclear Power
- Nuclear power as a source of electricity
- EBR-1: The world's first nuclear power plant
- Purpose of the Smarter Every Day Deep Dive series into nuclear power

### EBR-1: Experimental Breeder Reactor 1
- Location: Idaho National Laboratory
- Built in the 1950s
- Key features:
  - First breeder reactor
  - Produced both heat and plutonium

### How EBR-1 Works
#### Nuclear Fission
- Uranium-235 (U-235) as the primary fuel
- Fast neutrons initiate fission
- Process:
  - Fast neutron hits U-235, creating U-236
  - U-236 splits into two new atoms (e.g., krypton and barium)
  - Releases heat and additional fast neutrons
- Chain reaction sustains the process

#### Breeder Reactor Concept
- Uranium-238 (U-238) as the breeding material
- Fast neutrons convert U-238 into plutonium-239 (Pu-239)
- Breeding process:
  - Fast neutron hits U-238, creating U-239
  - Beta decay converts U-239 into neptunium-239
  - Second beta decay converts neptunium-239 into Pu-239

#### Heat Exchange and Electricity Generation
- Liquid metal coolant (NAK: sodium and potassium) transfers heat from the reactor
- Three-loop system:
  - Primary loop: NAK coolant
  - Secondary loop: NAK coolant
  - Tertiary loop: Water heated to produce steam
- Steam drives a turbine connected to a generator, producing electricity

### Safety Features of EBR-1
- Isolation of radioactive materials in the primary loop
- Use of argon gas to prevent coolant explosions
- Scram systems:
  - Control rods to slow the reaction
  - Emergency shutdown by dropping the breeding blanket

### Historical Significance
- First electricity generated from nuclear power on December 20, 1951
- Symbolism of nuclear power as a peaceful energy source
- Legacy of the Manhattan Project and the transition to civilian applications

### Terms
- **Nuclear Fission**: The process of splitting an atomic nucleus into smaller nuclei, releasing energy.
- **Breeder Reactor**: A nuclear reactor that produces more fissile material than it consumes by converting non-fissile isotopes (e.g., U-238) into fissile isotopes (e.g., Pu-239).
- **Fast Neutron**: A high-energy neutron that initiates fission in reactors like EBR-1.
- **NAK (Sodium-Potassium Alloy)**: A liquid metal coolant used in EBR-1 to transfer heat and maintain fast neutron speeds.
- **Scram**: An emergency shutdown of a nuclear reactor, typically by inserting control rods or dropping the breeding blanket.
- **Heat Exchanger**: A device that transfers heat from one fluid to another without mixing them.
- **Beta Decay**: A radioactive decay process where a neutron transforms into a proton, emitting an electron (beta particle).
- **Plutonium-239 (Pu-239)**: A fissile isotope produced in breeder reactors, used as nuclear fuel.
