### Rousseau's Background and Significance
- Born in 1712, died in 1778
- Swiss philosopher who identified as "citizen of Geneva"
- Lived during the waning years of absolutism in France
- Abandoned home at 16, lived a varied life before literary fame
- Published First Discourse in 1750, Second Discourse in 1755
- Published Social Contract and Émile in 1762
- Author of multiple works spanning philosophy, politics, autobiography, music

### The Second Discourse: Methodology and Approach
- A "conjectural history" - philosophical reconstruction rather than empirical history
- Compares human nature to the statue of Glaucus, disfigured by time
- Uses thought experiment to understand original human nature
- Rejects previous philosophers' views of state of nature
- Claims to read human history through nature, which "never lies"

### Rousseau's State of Nature
- Criticizes Hobbes and Locke for not taking nature seriously enough
- Views natural man as more animal-like than previous philosophers acknowledged
- Rejects that war (Hobbes) or rationality/property (Locke) existed in nature
- Identifies two distinguishing human qualities:
  - Free agency/freedom
  - Perfectibility (openness to change)
- Adds a third natural quality: pitié (compassion/pity)
- Believes humans are naturally sensitive, compassionate creatures
- Argues reason develops egoism and calculation, corrupting natural compassion

### Civilization and Property
- Property as the foundation of civil society
- "The first person who... said this is mine... was the true founder of civil society"
- Critical of property's role in creating inequality and social ills
- Rejects Locke's view that emancipation of acquisition benefits everyone
- Values dignity and independence over material comforts
- Ancient politics focused on virtue; modern politics on commerce and money
- Market economies create material improvements but introduce vast inequalities
- Civilization transforms natural man into a calculating bourgeois

### Terms
- Conjectural History - A philosophical reconstruction of history based on reasoning rather than empirical evidence
- Perfectibility - Rousseau's term for humans' unique openness to change and ability to transform over time
- Pitié - Natural compassion or pity that Rousseau believed was inherent to human nature
- Sauvage - "Savage" or natural man whom Rousseau often contrasts favorably with civilized Europeans
- Bourgeois - Term Rousseau uses to describe the calculating, self-interested modern person
