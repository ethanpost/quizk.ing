# From Flat to 3D: Adding and Subtracting Features in CAD - Quiz

## Outline

### Introduction to 3D CAD Features
- Adding dimension to CAD parts is a multi-step process
- Not all CAD parts are flat - some require 3D features
- Example used: washer design with additional features

### Key Process Steps
- Create a sketch on the actual object surface (not origin planes)
- Choose to either add or subtract from the body
- Use extrude operation to apply changes

### Key Terms: Join and Cut Operations
- Join operation: adds material to the existing body
- Cut operation: subtracts material from the existing body
- These are the two main options in the extrude process

### Practical Demonstration: Creating Features on a Washer
- Starting with an existing washer body
- Creating a new sketch on the washer surface
- Drawing two circles of equal size
- Adding construction lines for proper dimensioning
- Setting constraints: equal circles, 90-degree angles, 45-degree angle
- Setting hole diameter to 12 mm
- Ensuring all lines turn black (fully constrained)

### Adding Material: Join Operation
- Selecting the first circle/profile
- Using extrude with join operation
- Adding 5 mm dimension
- Result: pin design added to washer
- Creates one unified body (not separate components)
- Sketch disappears after operation

### Subtracting Material: Cut Operation
- Re-showing the sketch using the eyeball icon
- Selecting the second circle/profile
- Using extrude with cut operation
- Direction matters: up switches to join, down/through switches to cut
- Red color indicates cut operation
- Result: hole created in the washer

### Important Concepts
- Multiple bodies can be selected for operations
- Direction of extrude determines operation type
- Sketches disappear after successful operations
- All features become part of one unified body
- Robust sketching requires all lines to be black (fully constrained)

### Terms
- Join - An extrude operation that adds material to an existing body
- Cut - An extrude operation that subtracts material from an existing body
- Extrude - A CAD operation that extends a 2D sketch into 3D space
- Construction lines - Reference lines used for dimensioning and constraints
- Fully constrained - When all sketch elements are properly dimensioned and constrained (appear black)
- Origin planes - The default reference planes (XY, XZ, YZ) in CAD software
- Surface sketch - A sketch created directly on a 3D object's surface rather than on origin planes

## Master Answer Key

1. B – Adding dimension to CAD parts creates 3D features and complexity, moving beyond flat designs to more sophisticated parts.

2. B – Join and cut are the two main operations in the extrude process, allowing you to either add or subtract material.

3. B – The join operation adds material to an existing body, creating features like pins or protrusions.

4. C – The cut operation subtracts material from an existing body, creating holes or removing sections.

5. B – Sketches for 3D features should be created on the actual object surface, not on origin planes, to properly interface with the existing geometry.

6. B – When all lines turn black, it indicates the sketch is fully constrained with proper dimensions and relationships.

7. B – The holes in the demonstration were set to 12 mm diameter for the washer design.

8. B – Sketches disappear after successful extrude operations, which is normal behavior in CAD software.

9. C – The join operation keeps everything as one unified body rather than creating separate components.

10. B – The eyeball icon is used to toggle sketch visibility, allowing you to re-show sketches that have disappeared.

11. B – Dragging the extrude direction upward switches the operation to join, while downward switches to cut.

12. C – Red color indicates a cut operation is being performed, providing visual feedback about the operation type.

13. B – The construction lines were set at 45 degrees to create the desired angular relationship in the design.

14. B – Construction lines serve as reference geometry for dimensioning and applying constraints to create robust sketches.

15. C – When multiple bodies exist, you can select which specific object you want to cut or not cut during the operation.

16. B – "Robust" refers to a sketch being fully constrained with all necessary dimensions and relationships properly defined.
