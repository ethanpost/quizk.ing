### Webb's Mirror Material
- Gold is only on the surface of Webb's mirrors
- The bulk of the mirrors are made of beryllium metal

### Key Properties of Beryllium
- Extremely lightweight
  - Second lightest of all metals
  - Two-thirds the weight of aluminum
- Exceptional strength
  - Six times stiffer than steel
  - Demonstrated through cantilever experiment
  - Less vibration intensity and faster stabilization
- Thermal stability
  - Maintains shape across broad temperature ranges
  - Particularly important in cold environments
  - Shrinks less than aluminum when cooled
  - Stops changing size below 100 Kelvin

### Challenges with Beryllium
- Requires extreme care in machining
  - Powder pressed together requiring light cuts
  - Prone to cracking if mistakes are made
- Cost considerations
  - $1,800 to $2,000 per pound
  - Can be fragile under wrong circumstances

### Importance for Space Applications
- Weight savings critical for rocket launches
  - Rockets need significant fuel for each pound of payload
  - Lightweight materials provide substantial benefits

### Terms
- Beryllium - A lightweight metal used for Webb telescope mirrors that is six times stiffer than steel and maintains its shape in extreme temperatures
- Coefficient of thermal expansion - A measure of how much a material changes in shape, volume, and density in response to temperature changes
- Kelvin - A temperature scale used in science where 0 Kelvin is absolute zero
- Cantilever - A rigid structural element anchored at only one end, used to demonstrate material properties
- Payload - The carrying capacity of a rocket, including the weight of everything being sent to space
