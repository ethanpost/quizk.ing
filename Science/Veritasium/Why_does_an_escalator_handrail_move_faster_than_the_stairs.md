### Historical Development
- First escalator (1896) - Jesse Reno's "Continuous Elevator"
  - 25-degree incline conveyor belt
  - No steps, just metal and wooden parts
  - Used as theme park attraction at Coney Island
  - 75,000 people rode it in two weeks
- Early problems with design
  - 25-degree angle was too steep for comfortable walking
  - Around 12 degrees is where walking becomes difficult
  - 25 degrees is roughly the limit of ankle flexibility
- Revolving stairs solution (attempted for 4 decades)
  - Chain with fixed stair-shaped blocks
  - Problems at top and bottom where steps tilted
  - Dangerous gaps when steps disappeared under wooden board

### Modern Escalator Design
- George Wheeler's breakthrough design (basis for all modern escalators)
  - Steps attached to chain through single axle for rotation freedom
  - Second set of wheels following different track
  - Two tracks overlap on incline, separate at top and bottom
  - Steps flip upside down during return journey
- Charles Seeberger's commercialization
  - Bought Wheeler's patent 8 years later
  - Partnered with Otis Elevator Company
  - First commercial escalator at 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle
  - Awarded grand prize at the fair

### Mechanical Components
- Electric motor (50 kilowatts, 1000+ RPM)
- Reduction gearbox system
  - Lowers output to few RPM
  - Increases torque by factor of ~100
- Step chain with wheels for smooth curves
- Two-track system for step angle control
- Handrail system with separate friction wheel drive

### Safety Features
- Comb plate system
  - Grooved steps interlock with comb plate
  - Lifts small items out of harm's way
  - Allows safe forward stepping
- Skirt brush (added 1982)
  - Addresses side gap safety issues
- Multiple braking systems
  - Main brake on metal drum
  - Auxiliary brake with steel wedges
  - Safety relay system

### Handrail Speed Mystery
- Handrail moves ~2% faster than steps
- Compensation for friction wheel wear over time
- As wheel circumference decreases, handrail slows
- Calibration ensures handrail doesn't lag too far behind

### Regenerative Braking System
- AC induction motors create rotating magnetic field
- On downward escalators with heavy loads
- Motor converts to generator when resisting excess force
- Generates electricity fed back to building grid
- Powers upward escalators and other devices

### Rome Escalator Disaster (2018)
- October 23rd, 2018 at Republica station
- Crowd weight overwhelmed motor resistance
- Three safety systems failed in sequence
- 24 people injured
- Investigation revealed maintenance negligence
- Error logging disabled, maintenance records falsified
- 11 suspects named, including ATAC managers and Metro Roma chief

### Safety Analysis
- Properly maintained escalators have enormous safety margins
- Step breaking load: 15 kilonewtons (1.5 tons)
- Can support elephant weight without breaking
- 1.5 million escalators worldwide
- 100+ billion trips annually in US/Canada
- Catastrophic failure chances are vanishingly small with proper maintenance

### Terms
- Continuous Elevator - Jesse Reno's first escalator design from 1896, a 25-degree inclined conveyor belt used as a theme park attraction
- Revolving Stairs - Early escalator design with fixed stair-shaped blocks on a chain, plagued by dangerous tilting at top and bottom
- Step Chain - Reinforced steel chain that pulls escalator steps around a loop, fitted with wheels for smooth curves
- Comb Plate - Safety device at escalator ends with grooves that interlock with step grooves to prevent items from getting caught
- Skirt Brush - Safety feature added in 1982 to address side gap safety issues on escalators
- Regenerative Braking - System where AC induction motors convert excess mechanical energy into electrical energy on downward escalators
- Auxiliary Brake - Emergency brake system that bypasses motor entirely and directly locks drive shaft
- Reduction Gearbox - System that converts high-speed, low-torque motor output into low-speed, high-torque output for driving steps
