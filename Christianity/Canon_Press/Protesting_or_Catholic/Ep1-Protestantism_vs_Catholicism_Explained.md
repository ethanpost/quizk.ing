## Protestantism vs Catholicism Overview

### Introduction
- Six-part series exploring major distinctives between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism
- High altitude overview of real differences
- Tour guide approach for clarity, not academic dissertation
- Supplemental resources linked for deeper study
- Respect for Catholic friends and thinkers acknowledged
- Conservative Catholics and Protestants are allies on many cultural issues
- Core differences are not trivial and include justification, gospel, Mary, veneration of saints, sacraments, papal authority, church councils, and scriptures

### What is Roman Catholicism?
- Claims to be the one true church established by Jesus Christ
- Presided over by the bishop of Rome (Pope)
- Pope wields apostolic authority as Jesus Christ's visible representative on earth
- Singular claim to authority is central to Roman church's identity for the last millennium and a half
- Pope claims succession from Apostle Peter
- Peter supposedly given keys to bind and loose in Matthew 16
- Keys and apostolic authority passed down through 2,000-year succession of popes
- Church councils guided by Holy Spirit and teach infallibly on faith and morals
- Pope can speak infallibly under certain circumstances
- Good Roman Catholics must submit to scripture and accumulated church teachings
- Magisterium is the teaching office of the Roman church
- Magisterium guards the deposit of faith
- Deposit of faith composed of two equally authoritative parts: scripture and tradition
- Magisterium is the authoritative interpreter of scripture and tradition
- Council of Trent says no one should contradict magisterium's interpretation of scripture
- Magisterial teaching represents logical outworking of doctrines over time guided by the Spirit
- Based on Jesus's promise in John 16:13 about the Spirit guiding into all truth
- Key distinctives accumulated over centuries: confession to priest, purgatory, justification by faith and works, Immaculate Conception of Mary, Assumption of Mary, prayers to and veneration of saints, transubstantiation
- Great diversity of emphasis and disagreement throughout history
- Global breadth leads to continued diversity (Latin mass, Vatican 2, liberation theology)

### What is Protestantism?
- Historically, Protestants were originally protesting Catholics
- Churches started as renewal and reform movements within Latin churches of Western Europe in early 1500s
- Reformation centered on scripture-based reform of doctrine and practice
- Resulted in shifts away from accumulated tradition
- Problems and corruptions in Renaissance church had been festering for years
- Martin Luther nailed 95 theses on church door at Wittenberg in 1517
- Luther wrote against indulgences (cash payments to get out of punishment for sin and purgatory)
- Issues broadened into all-encompassing reform effort based on scripture alone
- Entire nations severed ties with pope and Roman authority (Scotland, England, Netherlands, Scandinavia, German principalities)
- Two general traditions emerged: Lutheran and Reformed
- Anabaptists also emerged
- No centralized church government led to many Protestant denominations
- Denominations are governmental structures making no claim to be the one true church
- Common bond: repudiation of centralized Roman authority and infallible tradition
- Historic Protestants rally around variations of the five solas

### The Five Solas
- Sola Scriptura: Scripture alone is the infallible rule for faith and practice
- Scripture is the standard to which all things must be conformed
- Scripture transcends any pope, magisterial authority, or human institution
- Solus Christus: The work of Christ and Christ alone is the basis for justification before God
- Sola Fide: We receive justification in Christ by faith alone
- Based on Galatians 2:16 - not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ
- Sola Gratia: Our salvation start to finish is by the grace of God alone
- Soli Deo Gloria: All of this is by his grace, so the glory goes to God alone
- Summary: Scripture alone is infallible rule; justified by grace through faith in Christ alone to the glory of God alone
- Everything in church history can be reformed in light of scripture
- Ecumenical councils and theologians are genuine authorities but only as they submit to scripture
- Protestants viewed this as restoration, not creation of something new
- Ad fontes return to approach shared with much of early church
- House stripped of innovations, additions, and rot returned to original design
- Struggle between ancient sources versus ancient sources plus accumulated medieval tradition
- No one obligated to believe in things like Assumption of Mary or Immaculate Conception on Pope's say so
- Saying faith in these things is necessary for salvation is innovation and corruption of gospel

### Protestant Denominational Diversity
- Large diversity of denominations often emphasized by Catholic apologists
- Divisions can be distinguished as: geographic, theological schism, friendly institutional distinction
- Geographic: Theologically aligned churches may not have global church government uniting them
- Example: Dutch Reformed Church and Presbyterian Church in America have common theology but different geographic roots
- Theological schism: Example is Lutherans who separate over unique understanding of Christ's presence in Eucharist
- Generally only Lutherans allowed to commune at their churches
- Friendly institutional distinction: Churches with good relationships despite differences
- Differences like acceptance/rejection of infant baptism don't lead to complete separation
- Evangelicals, Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Anglicans, and Pentecostals can generally commune at each other's congregations
- Common experience of many Protestants to attend various denominations in full fellowship
- Fact of theological disagreements and lack of centralized government doesn't impact common love of scripture as ultimate authority
- Different distinctions intersect and complicated by battles over theological liberalism
- Since Protestants don't view their churches as the one true church, lack of institutional centralization is less of a problem

### Issues Protestants Have with Catholics
- Underlying problem: doctrinal and institutional accretions (slow, organic change over long periods)
- Vast majority of traditions distinguishing Catholicism are not apostolic nor biblical
- Result of slow evolutions over literal centuries
- Change that is unaccountable to the word of God and even contradictory to it
- Adding things to the gospel is not a small matter
- Church history is 10 times longer than US history and very decentralized
- Teaching appearing in fifth century is actually very late (hundreds of years from apostles)
- Not unreasonable to look for errors that crept in between death of Paul and writings of Basil or Chrysostom, let alone Middle Ages

### Four Central Problems
- Problem 1: The Papacy
  - Papacy not expressly taught anywhere in scriptures
  - Contrary to what Vatican 1 claims
  - Historical evidence shows role of bishop of Rome in early church was not what Roman apologists claim today
  - Pope now claims extraordinary powers
  - Papacy carried along by sheer heft and power as institution rather than strength of historical claims
  - Covered more thoroughly in episodes 2 and 3

- Problem 2: The Cult of Mary and Marian Dogmas
  - Mary is most blessed among women, Theotokos (godbearer), praised by angels, full of grace
  - Given greatest honor conceivable for a human
  - But official hyper-veneration of Mary and later Marian dogmas are contrary to scripture and church history
  - Take away from unique honor due to Christ
  - Explored in episode 4

- Problem 3: Justification by Faith
  - Current Roman church mangles teachings of Paul on grace and justification (especially Galatians and Romans)
  - Roman conception of grace and forgiveness developed in strange ways
  - Extreme abuses of indulgences, storage of merits, priestly mediation of forgiveness
  - Clear gospel of Christ as proclaimed by scripture is obscured
  - Believer is robbed of security
  - Covered in episode 6

- Problem 4: Inconsistencies, Errors, and Lack of Defined Tradition
  - Tradition or magisterial authority is extremely undefined
  - Some Catholics say pope has spoken infallibly only twice, others claim many times
  - Many popes believed themselves to be speaking authoritatively on many subjects
  - Issue is ambiguous, leaving thousands of possibly infallible documents that no one reads
  - Countless unsavory elements in Roman tradition (burning heretics, anti-semitism, indulgences for crusades, subjugation of infidels)
  - These were embraced as authoritative in past but now conveniently ignored
  - Questions about whether all non-Catholics are damned (Unam Sanctum, Supra quibusdam)
  - Questions about monetary interest, Spanish conquest authorization (Dum diversas)
  - Questions about papal authority in political situations
  - Tradition riddled with forgeries accepted and used as foundational, later quietly omitted
  - Special focus of episode 5

### Conclusion
- All these errors ought to be rejected
- Not supported by the word of God
- Not supported by early traditions of the church
- Ultimately distract from true preaching of Christ
- Misquoted saying from Cardinal John Henry Newman: "To be deep in history is to cease to be Protestant"
- But to be even deeper in history means moving past trends and fads back to infallible word of God
- History and scripture, early church fathers and apostles led reformers to see how far Renaissance church had wandered
- To be truly deep in history is to be Pauline and Protestant
- Clinging to pure word of God and rejecting accumulated errors and abuses of men
- Theology of indulgences, medieval power grabs by Pope, forgeries, weird Marian theology, and more
