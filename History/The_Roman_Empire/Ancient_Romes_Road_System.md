### Overview and Scale
- Romans constructed approximately 50,000 miles of hard-surfaced roads
- Additional 200,000 miles of various road types (including dirt paths)
- Total of 250,000 miles of roads throughout the empire
- At peak, 372 "great roads" connected 113 provinces
- 29 separate roads radiated out from Rome

### First Major Roads
- Via Appia (Appian Way) - first great road, constructed around 312 BCE
  - Initially 162 miles from Rome to Torrentium
  - Later extended to Brundisium (Brindisi)
- Via Poplilia - 321 miles from Rome to Straits of Messina
- Via Aurelia - extended northwest to Genoa
- Via Flaminia - ran north to the Adriatic
- Via Valeria - east across the peninsula towards Lake Fucinus

### Purpose and Evolution
- Roads initially built for military purposes
- Function evolved to support trade as empire stabilized
- Roads helped unite the empire politically and culturally
- Example: Watling Street (Route 2) in Britain
  - Originally a dirt track used by ancient Britons
  - Paved by Romans after 43 CE invasion
  - Site of defeat of Queen Boudicca (60/61 CE)
  - Still used today (modern A2 and A5 roads)

### Road Construction Standards
- Regulated by the 12 Tables legislation
- Width requirements:
  - Standard width: 8 Roman feet (2.37 meters)
  - Curved sections: 16 Roman feet (4.74 meters)
  - Larger public roads: 12 Roman feet (3.5 meters)
- Roman foot = 11.6 inches (compared to modern foot of 12 inches)

### Road Usage Regulations
- Rights to use roads known as "servitus"
- Ius eundi: right to use footpaths (iter)
- Ius agendi: right to drive on carriage tracks (actus)
- Traffic regulations included:
  - Carts forbidden in urban areas (exceptions for married women and government officials)
  - Commercial carts restricted to nighttime access within cities

### Road Classification System
- Via publicae: major public roads built and maintained through taxes
  - Led to sea, towns, rivers, or other roads
  - Named after their constructor/supervisor
- Via privatae: secondary roads constructed by private individuals
  - Usually branched off from via publicae
  - Access determined by owner
- Via vicinales: local roads passing through villages or districts
  - Could be public or private
  - Became public after owner's death if privately constructed

### Road Construction Process
- Typically a military responsibility (via militaris)
- Construction sequence:
  1. Civil engineer determined route
  2. Surveyor marked out road using metal rods
  3. Gromatici (rodmen) placed marking rods along rigor (designated line)
  4. Liberatores excavated surface down to bedrock (fossa)
  5. Ditch filled with multiple layers:
     - First layer: small stones
     - Second layer: rubble or broken concrete
     - Third layer: fine cement made of pot shards and lime
     - Top layer (dorsum): polygon blocks of local stone
  - Surface designed to be water-resistant with center crown
  - Drainage ditches along sides of major roads
  - Crepedo (pavement) for pedestrian use

### Bridges
- 931 Roman bridges identified across 26 countries
  - 800 in Europe, 74 in Asia, 57 in Africa
- Many still in use 2,000 years after construction
- Largest: Trajan Bridge over the Danube
  - Completed 105 CE
  - 1,135 meters long
  - 20 masonry pillars, approximately 19 meters high
  - Remained longest bridge in world for over 1,000 years

### Road Infrastructure and Services
- Milestones (miliaria)
  - Earliest examples on Via Appia (before 250 BCE)
  - Showed distance to Roman Forum
  - Circular columns or rectangular stones, at least 1.5 meters tall
  - Origin of word "mile" (Latin "mille passus" - 1,000 paces)
- Itinerarium (travel guides)
  - Lists of villages, towns, and cities along routes with distances
  - First master road itinerary commissioned by Julius Caesar in 44 BCE
  - Took 25 years to complete
- Accommodation and refreshments
  - Mansiones: government-maintained staying places every 16-19 miles
  - Cauponae: inns for refreshments
  - Tabernae: evolved from houses required to offer hospitality
- Postal service
  - Cursus publicus: relay system established by Emperor Augustus
  - Carried mail at 38-62 miles per day
  - Example: Rome to Alexandria (2,485 miles) took 63 days

### Legacy and Downfall
- Roads ultimately contributed to Rome's downfall
  - Enemies could use the same road network to attack
- Roman road system endured after empire collapsed
- Many Roman roads still in use today
