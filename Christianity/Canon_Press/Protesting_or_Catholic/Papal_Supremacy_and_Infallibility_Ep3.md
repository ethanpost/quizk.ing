## Outline

### Introduction to Papal Claims
- Modern papal claims developed through early Middle Ages into 18th and 19th centuries
- First Vatican Council (1869-1870) finalized modern formulations
- Bishop of Rome claims total supremacy over entire church without appeal
- Claims individual superiority over all church councils
- Claims ability to teach infallibly without error
- These claims are controversial to Protestants, Orthodox, and many past Roman Catholics

### Definition of Papal Supremacy
- According to Vatican 1, Roman primacy is not simply one of convention, honor, or ecclesiastical appeal
- It is one of supremacy with fullness of power
- Universal, ordinary, and immediate jurisdiction over entire church
- Superiority over church councils
- Council teachings have no authority unless pope recognizes their decisions
- Pope has functional and total veto power
- Medieval Catholic Church passionately battled against this
- Battle over conciliar power not won by Rome until 16th century in Fifth Lateran Council

### Definition of Papal Infallibility
- Pope claims infallible teaching authority under specific circumstances
- When he solemnly in virtue of his office defines a doctrine concerning faith and morals
- Doctrine must be held by the whole church
- Arguably first appeared in 12th or 13th centuries
- Not finally dogmatized until Vatican 1 in 1870

### Historical Claims (Now Disputed)
- Supreme power over all earthly rulers
- Pope once taught all authorities derived legitimacy from his recognition
- Most famously declared by Pope Boniface VIII in 1302 in bull Unam Sanctam
- Power struggle with King Philip IV of France
- Functionally declared ability to void governments or dissolve legitimacy of nation states
- Salvation dependent on submission to pope
- Numerous past popes claimed submission to papal jurisdiction was necessary prerequisite to salvation
- Boniface VIII decreed in Unam Sanctam that it is absolutely necessary for salvation to be subject to Roman pontiff
- Protestants find this claim ludicrous and even antichrist
- Peter did not hold such messianic authority in his own lifetime
- Paul rebuked Peter for being too friendly towards those adding extra steps to salvation

### Early Church History
- Historical narrative of how claims developed is very complex
- Key takeaway: this sort of authority was never recognized universally by early church
- Even as ideas of apostolic succession became entrenched and Rome's associations with Peter and Paul grew
- There was never a received consensus on universal Roman authority
- Eastern churches recognized primacy of honor or judicial appeal (established in Council of Sardica in 343)
- Never recognized authority to intervene in their affairs at will
- Fourth and fifth centuries in Latin West saw ideas take root
- Later in first thousand years, larger claims made by Rome and more likely Western bishops recognized them

### JND Kelly's Assessment
- Crucial question: whether primacy of honor was held to exist by divine right and involve overriding jurisdiction
- So far as East is concerned, answer must be by and large in the negative
- Eastern churches never treated Rome as constitutional center and head of church
- Never treated as infallible oracle on faith and morals
- On occasion had no compunction about resisting Rome's express will
- Every Protestant branch downstream of Reformation absolutely denounced such claims

### High Altitude Look at Growth of Papacy

#### Second Century
- By end of second century, Rome transitioned from rule of group of presbyters (bishops) to singular bishop over entire city
- Bishop of Rome quickly became important and influential
- Often important defender of orthodoxy against heresy
- Church fathers like Irenaeus stated everyone ought to look to Rome for guidance
- Yet this was nothing absolute
- Other bishops comfortable ignoring Roman bishop's wishes

#### Third Century
- First Roman bishop to attempt to meddle officially in affairs of Eastern bishops was Victor I
- Around 190 AD, Victor tried to sever communion with bishops in Asia Minor over Easter celebration
- Asian bishops completely disregarded Victor
- Eusebius notes bishops including Irenaeus issued stern rebuke of Victor's meddling
- Throughout 3rd century, Rome racked by schism internally and externally
- Experienced significant persecution
- Had communion severed with African and Eastern churches
- Other parts of church felt no need to obey Roman wishes
- Felt free to rebuke Rome over disagreements
- In 256, Cyprian of Carthage called synod in which 87 bishops repudiated Stephen of Rome's teaching on accepting heretical baptisms
- Cyprian took issue with Stephen appealing to special authority derived from Peter
- Cyprian reminded that Peter never showed arrogant pretensions or made special claims
- Cyprian railed against anyone who presumed to set himself up as bishop of bishops

#### Fourth Century - Constantine Era
- In 306, Emperor Constantine came to throne
- Convened Council of Nicaea in 325 after legalizing Christianity
- Official canons show government of regional churches crystallizing under regional patriarchates
- Bishops of Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem each had their own jurisdiction
- Largely mirroring hierarchy of political Roman provincial system
- Canon six: ancient custom should prevail in Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis that bishop of Alexandria should have authority over all these
- Same custom with Roman bishop himself
- Shows Alexandria had authority over Egypt and Libya just as Rome did over its surrounding areas
- Reflects how Rome was quick in consolidation of power in west
- Patriarchates seen as having distinct and parallel jurisdictions
- At end of Constantine's reign, moved imperial capital from Rome to Constantinople
- Bishop of Constantinople rapidly gained power in church much to Rome's chagrin

#### Council of Sardica (343)
- After Constantine's death, Council of Sardica held in 343 in modern Bulgaria
- Meant to be ecumenical council but ended up abysmal failure
- Very importantly established Roman appellate jurisdiction for trials of bishops
- Bishops could appeal regional disciplinary decisions to Rome as last resort

#### Pope Damasus (366-384)
- Some have described as first definite self-expression of papacy
- Spurred Jerome to translate Vulgate
- First recorded person to use term "apostolic see" as unique reference to Rome and its authority
- Comes full 300 years after death of Peter
- In 381, Council of Constantinople held in east
- In 382, Damasus presided over synod that rebuffed some canonical reasoning of Constantinople
- Asserted Rome's position was not set up by synods, but derived authority directly from apostles Peter and Paul
- First time this entered official Roman theology
- More than three centuries after deaths of Peter and Paul

#### Pope Siricius (384-399)
- Author of first indisputable decretal
- Type of letter politically modeled on Roman imperial decree
- Would become foundational to western canon law
- Decretal further developed Petrine succession language and exegesis backing Rome's unique authority

#### Fifth Century
- Turbulent century for Rome
- Visigoth king Alaric sacked Rome in 410
- Papacy through system of decretals communicated with disintegrating Western Empire
- Provided needed central leadership at home and abroad
- Controversies led to Councils of Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451)
- Popes were important players
- Fault lines between east and west already set more intractably than Constantinople one
- In Canon 28 of Chalcedon, council fathers directly rejected idea of inherent Roman primacy
- Reiterated decree from Council of Constantinople
- Said Roman privilege had been awarded on basis of being center of imperial power
- Not based on unique apostolic authority
- New imperial city of Constantinople expected same treatment
- Pope Leo naturally objected
- Recognized doctrinal decisions but rejected Canon 28
- Invoked Apostle Peter's authority
- East paid no heed to Rome's protest
- Continued to operate in accordance with council's decision
- Rome continued to consolidate power and clarify claims in west
- Leo the Great was Roman aristocrat and patriot deeply devoted to his city
- Famously persuaded Attila the Hun to turn back from invasion of Italy in 452
- Helped preserve Roman civic identity
- In swirl of ecclesiastical and political chaos, papacy started to truly come into its own

### The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
- Ascent of papacy has share of true heroism as well as share of villain
- Would take another 600 years until anyone began making claims expansive enough to rival Vatican 1 in 1870

### Canon Law and Forgeries
- After first ecumenical councils, disputes over canon law become central to story
- Canon law: set of laws and ordinances instituted for governance of church
- Each local synod and general council normally issuing list of canons or rules
- Canon lawyers and theologians were distinct groups
- Often operated somewhat separately from each other
- Theological arguments became political struggles
- Political struggles became theological arguments
- Fights over canon law and forgeries being successfully added to canon law are integral part of story
- Part of how papacy transitioned from late antiquity to middle ages

### Symmachan Forgeries (6th Century)
- Important early example of forgery happened during Laurentian Schism
- In sixth century, two men Symmachus and Laurentius both claimed position of pope
- Split the clergy
- Partisans of Symmachus forged 11 documents
- Taken as genuine and after being circulated in official canonical collections greatly affected canon law to this day
- Main point: principle called "prima sedes a nemine iudicatur" (first seat is judged by no one)
- For centuries, those forgeries successfully established false canonical precedent
- No ecclesiastical mechanism had authority to judge the pope
- Cornerstone in building medieval papacy

### Pseudo-Isidorian Corpus (9th Century)
- Largest and most influential body of forgeries
- Came hundreds of years later in 9th century
- Seem to have originated from monastery in west during reign of Louis the Pious (Charlemagne's son)
- Author or authors was incredibly erudite and talented forger
- Desired to expand clergy's power over against local rulers
- Big part was expanding papal privileges at expense of local governments
- Collection accepted as authentic by almost everyone for more than four centuries
- Became interwoven with most prestigious collections of canon law
- Played crucial role in expansion of papal power in Investiture Controversy (11th and 12th centuries)
- Three main parts: first entirely fraudulent, second mostly authentic, third mixed together
- First part particularly brazen
- Fabricated history of papal teaching to infill first three centuries of church history with Roman power and influence
- Part one begins with preliminary texts including important forward by supposed author Isidorus Mercator
- Follows collection of 60 decretals by bishops of Rome from Anacletus to Miltiades
- All of these papal decretals are false
- No surviving authentic letters from any of these bishops of Rome
- Bold and unparalleled project: forging of documents by no less than 29 successive popes
- Second part contained Donation of Constantine
- Claimed Constantine had given Pope Sylvester title to entire western half of empire
- Important for Pope's political claims on papal states throughout Middle Ages
- Helped make pope secular head of state to this day
- Authority of Rome over universal church was important topic in collection
- Forger put forward ideas:
  - A) Only bishop of Rome can summon church council
  - B) Council held without approval of pope is invalid
  - C) Not only must council be summoned by bishop of Rome but his legates also have right to preside over it
  - D) All council's decisions require pope's approval
  - E) Pope is responsible for all important matters of church including everything concerning higher clergy
  - F) Bishops being prosecuted locally may appeal to pope who has power to protect them and revoke any conviction
  - G) Pope can terminate any proceedings against any accused bishop if he so pleases
  - H) Most importantly: no authority within or outside church can prevail over verdict of apostolic see in Rome
- These forgeries permeated most prestigious canonical collections in west for centuries
- Including Gratian's Decretum and others
- Literally all canon lawyers relied on them
- Hard to overestimate effect of such successful deception
- Systemic and universal in medieval Latin church
- Provided completely fraudulent view of church up through 4th century
- Wildly inaccurate view after that
- Forgeries began to be rigorously questioned by John of Torquemada and Nicholas of Cusa in 15th century
- Only finally and decisively shown to be forgeries by Calvinist minister in 1600s
- By time forgeries acknowledged as such, history was what it was
- Immeasurable damage had been done to trajectory of Roman church

### Middle Ages Development
- Well before Great Schism, canon lawyers and theologians in west affirmed pope had fullness of power and supremacy
- These forgeries all took place before schism
- Took number of additional developments before there would be any claims of infallibility

### Mendicant Orders
- High Middle Ages saw founding and flourishing of mendicant (nomadic, poverty-less, alms-begging) orders of friars
- Completely transformed religious landscape of Latin West
- Interesting cultural curveball that created new political frictions
- Ordinary bishops and priests didn't like friars infringing on their turf
- Lifestyle and theology of especially Franciscans was suspect to many people
- Friars (both Dominicans and Franciscans) heavily relied on papacy to protect them and legitimize their activities
- In turn, once they became important theological force, many started aggressively advancing papal interests
- Extraordinary dependence of Franciscans on papacy in sphere of doctrine as well as discipline
- Difference between Bonaventure (13th century minister general of Franciscans) and theologians of Paris
- For secular masters, each bishop wielded autonomous authority derived directly from Christ
- Bonaventure suggested rather that bishops were more delegates or vicars of pope
- Just as parish priests were vicars of bishops
- Father Yves Congar called Bonaventure principal theoretician of papal monarchy in 13th century
- Though Bonaventure crucial for expansion of papal power, he never actually advanced theory of papal infallibility
- That honor would fall to Peter Olivi, another Franciscan
- Would be more than 600 years after this before this view became universal

### Struggles Against Papal Claims
- Struggles against conciliarism in 1300s and 1500s
- Protestantism in 1500s
- Gallicanism in 1600s and 1700s
- Mostly concerning relationship of pope and council

### Council of Constance (1414)
- Convoked in 1414
- Deposed three popes of papal schism and reinstated new pope
- Affirmed conciliar authority in its documents such as decree Haec Sancta

### Papal Response to Conciliarism
- In 1441, Pope Eugenius IV declared papal supremacy over councils in his bull Execrabilis
- Dominican friars such as John of Torquemada aggressively advanced papalist stance

### Gallicanism
- France was bastion of Gallicanism
- Main continuation of conciliar theory after Reformation
- Lost its institutional foothold after French Revolution
- Paved way for victory of hyper-papalists in 19th century

### Road to Vatican 1
- Power struggles were integral part of road to Vatican 1 in 1870
- From Protestant perspective, extravagant claims by papacy are deeply problematic historically and scripturally
- Both in their own right and because of how they causally underlie many other doctrinal differences
- Given historical weakness of Vatican 1's claims, entire system is house of cards
- Took from historical perspective very very long time for papacy to develop to point where making such dramatic claims
- Classic case of slow accretions over time
- Current claims projected back onto periods where they would have been completely unheard of
- Claim to universal immediate jurisdiction
- Supposed relationship between popes and councils
- Claim to infallibility
- They are simply not apostolic
- Completely dependent on past imperial politics as well as forgeries
- Clearly not taught in scripture
- At no point were they universal belief of early church
- They are not legitimate development of doctrine
- Not logical outgrowth of deposit of faith
- They are major cause of schism
