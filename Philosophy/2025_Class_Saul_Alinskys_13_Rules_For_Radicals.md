### Rule 1: Power is not what you have but what your enemy thinks you have
- Create perception of power and resources
- Can fool adversaries into thinking you have more organizational ability
- Effective in legislative battles and boycott threats
- Implied power can be powerful in itself

### Rule 2: Never go outside the experience of your people
- People are uncomfortable with unfamiliar tactics
- Use strategies people understand and know
- Continue training people to become familiar with new tactics
- Keep followers in their comfort zone

### Rule 3: Always go outside the experience of your enemy
- Keep adversaries off balance
- Create uncertainty and fear
- Make enemies address unexpected issues
- Force opponents to respond to unfamiliar tactics

### Rule 4: Make the enemy live up to their own book of rules
- Catch opponents in contradictions
- Hold adversaries to their standards
- Don't hold yourself to the same standards
- Common tactic in modern political campaigns
- Example: Attacking right-wing candidates for minor statistical errors while excusing left-wing misstatements

### Rule 5: Ridicule is man's most potent weapon
- Turn enemies into objects of ridicule
- Almost no defense against mockery
- Example: 2012 campaign against Rick Santorum
- Devastating when someone becomes a joke or ridiculous figure

### Rule 6: A good tactic is one your people enjoy
- People perform with more vigor when enjoying activities
- Increases imagination and involvement
- Boosts participation and effectiveness

### Rule 7: A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag
- People get bored without visible results
- Can become counterproductive
- Example: Occupy movement eventually petered out from lack of progress

### Rule 8: Keep pressure on
- Don't give adversaries a chance to regroup
- Constant pressure prevents counter-attacks
- Don't let up during campaigns

### Rule 9: The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself
- Adversaries expend resources defending against potential threats
- Works with Rule 1 to imply power
- Effective for keeping opponents off guard

### Rule 10: Maintain constant pressure upon the opposition
- Left views politics as constant war, not isolated battles
- Contrasts with right-wing approach of treating politics like sporting events
- Requires persistent engagement

### Rule 11: Push a negative hard enough until it breaks through to its counterside
- Persistent pushing may win public sympathy
- Can provoke opponents into overreacting
- Overreactions can generate public support

### Rule 12: Have a constructive alternative ready
- Need prepared demands and solutions
- Important for legislative battles and policy changes
- Be ready when opponents cave

### Rule 13: Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, polarize it
- Make specific opponents "radioactive"
- Used regularly in political campaigns
- Example: Labeling targets as "racist"
- Strategy to make opponents untouchable

### Terms
- Alinsky Rules - Strategic principles for community organizing and activism developed by Saul Alinsky
- Ridicule - Using mockery as a political weapon against opponents
- Polarization - The tactic of creating sharp divisions between groups to isolate opponents
- Constant Pressure - Maintaining unrelenting engagement with opposition without breaks
