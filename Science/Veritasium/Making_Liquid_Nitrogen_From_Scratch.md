### Introduction
- Nitrogen makes up 78% of atmosphere
- Used in Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew
- Project goal: Liquify nitrogen from air

### Equipment and Components
- Cryocooler
  - Contains helium and pistons
  - Compresses and expands helium
  - Creates temperatures below -200°C
  - Heat sink ejects heat during compression
  - Cold end absorbs heat during expansion

### Process Steps
1. Initial Air Liquefaction
   - Ran cryocooler for 4 hours
   - Successfully produced 50ml liquid air
   - Required condensing 35L of room air

2. Oxygen Separation
   - Used magnetic properties to extract liquid oxygen
   - Demonstrated oxygen presence through flame test
   - Flame reignited when exposed to liquid oxygen

3. Pure Nitrogen Production
   - Used air compressor (10 atmospheres pressure)
   - Implemented water vapor filter
   - Utilized nitrogen membrane
     - Contains hollow polymer fibers
     - Selectively permeable material
     - Allows faster diffusion of oxygen/CO2/water vapor
     - Achieved 99.7% pure nitrogen

4. Nitrogen Liquefaction
   - Required multiple design iterations
   - Final setup used smaller flask with tight seals
   - Successfully produced small amount of liquid nitrogen

### Applications
- Ice cream making
  - Fast freezing creates small ice crystals
  - Results in smooth texture
- Nitro Cold Brew
  - Creates smaller bubbles than CO2
  - Produces creamy texture
  - Nitrogen remains inert (unlike CO2)
  - Shows unique cascading bubble effect

### Terms
- Cryocooler - Device that uses compressed and expanded helium to create extremely cold temperatures
- Paramagnetic - Property of being attracted to magnetic fields (like liquid oxygen)
- Selectively Permeable - Material that allows some molecules to pass through more easily than others
- Dewar - Insulated container for storing very cold liquids
- Nitrogen Membrane - Specialized filter containing polymer fibers that separates nitrogen from other gases
