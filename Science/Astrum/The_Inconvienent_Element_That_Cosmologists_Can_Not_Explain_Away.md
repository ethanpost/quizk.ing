## The Lithium Problem

### The Big Bang Theory Overview
- Theory conceived to explain the beginning of the universe
- Based on observation that the universe is expanding
- Proposes universe began as a hot, dense singularity
- Predicts distribution of elements in early universe
- Supported by cosmic background radiation evidence

### Understanding Lithium
- Alkali metal with 3 protons in its nucleus
- Soft metal that reacts with water
- Used in batteries and electronic devices
- One of few lightweight elements created in early universe
- Important isotopes: Lithium-7 (3 protons, 4 neutrons) and Lithium-6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons)

### Early Universe Timeline
- First second: Too hot for matter to form (~10 trillion degrees C)
- Universe existed as radiation
- By 100 seconds: Cooled to ~1 trillion degrees C
- Strong force became active, allowing protons to bind with neutrons
- Formation of hydrogen, deuterium, and helium through nuclear fusion
- Early universe composition: ~76% hydrogen, ~24% helium, 0.00000007% lithium

### The Discrepancy
- Predicted lithium abundance is 3 times higher than observed amounts
- Lithium-6 to Lithium-7 ratio is problematic
- Lithium-6 is 1000 times more prevalent than theoretical predictions

## Possible Explanations

### Theoretical Model Issues
- Hot Big Bang model may need revision
- Quantum effects may eliminate the need for a singularity
- Stephen Hawking revised his views on the singularity concept
- Model may need adjustment while preserving key principles

### Observational Challenges
- Difficulty measuring small amounts of lithium in distant matter
- Limited to examining spectroscopic data
- Reliance on primordial stars which may not represent the universe as a whole
- Stars may have processes altering their lithium content

### Scientific Perspective
- All data must match theory for complete understanding
- Similar problems exist with other elements (e.g., gold)
- Confidence that the Lithium Problem will eventually be solved
- Ongoing quest to understand universe's origins
