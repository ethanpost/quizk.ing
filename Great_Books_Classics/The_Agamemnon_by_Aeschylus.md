## Opening: The Watchman’s Vigil (Lines 1–39)

-   Setting: The rooftop of the palace in Argos, at night.
    
-   Events: A watchman, stationed for years, waits for a signal fire announcing Troy’s fall. He’s weary, loyal to Agamemnon, but hints at unease about the palace’s “sickness”—a veiled reference to Clytemnestra’s plotting. Suddenly, he spots the beacon, joyfully announces Troy’s defeat, and rushes to inform the queen.
    
-   Key Details: The watchman’s cryptic dread sets a tone of foreboding. The beacon system (a chain of fires across the Aegean) symbolizes both victory and the rapid spread of consequences.

## Chorus Enters: The Parodos (Lines 40–257)

-   Characters: The Chorus of Argive elders, old men too frail to fight in Troy.
    
-   Events: The Chorus reflects on the war’s origins ten years prior. They recount how Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, led the Greeks to Troy to reclaim Helen, stolen by Paris. They describe the omen at Aulis: two eagles devouring a pregnant hare, interpreted by the prophet Calchas as a sign of victory over Troy but also a warning—Artemis demands a sacrifice for the eagles’ act. Agamemnon, under pressure, sacrifices his daughter Iphigenia to secure winds for the fleet, a choice that “yoked him to necessity.”
    
-   Key Details: The Chorus wrestles with Agamemnon’s guilt, calling it a “bitter choice.” Clytemnestra’s grief is foreshadowed as a motive. The ode blends triumph with dread, noting Zeus’s law: “wisdom comes through suffering.”
    
## Clytemnestra’s Announcement (Lines 258–354)

-   Characters: Clytemnestra enters, addressing the Chorus.
    
-   Events: Clytemnestra confirms the watchman’s news—Troy has fallen. She describes the relay of beacon fires from Troy to Argos, painting a vivid picture of the flames leaping from peak to peak. She imagines the Greeks sacking Troy, mixing victory cries with the wails of the vanquished. She warns that the gods might punish the victors if they desecrate Troy’s shrines, a subtle hint at Agamemnon’s vulnerability.
    
-   Key Details: Clytemnestra’s speech is masterful—publicly triumphant, privately ironic. She’s in control, already plotting, and her vivid imagery (e.g., Troy’s “first night of ruin”) shows her calculating mind.


## Chorus’s First Ode: Hymn to Zeus (Lines 355–487)

-   Events: The Chorus sings of Zeus’s justice, reflecting on Paris’s crime (abducting Helen) and Troy’s punishment. They revisit Agamemnon’s sacrifice of Iphigenia, describing her gagged pleas and the altar’s blood. They lament the war’s toll on Argos—sons lost, urns of ashes returned—and question divine will, ending with uneasy praise for Zeus, “whoever he is.”
    
-   Key Details: This ode deepens the moral ambiguity. Iphigenia’s death haunts the narrative, and the Chorus’s unease mirrors Argos’s instability. Their fear of hubris foreshadows Agamemnon’s fate.


## The Herald’s Arrival (Lines 488–680)

-   Characters: A Herald from Agamemnon’s army enters, greeted by the Chorus.
    
-   Events: The Herald announces Agamemnon’s imminent return, praising the king for avenging Helen and destroying Troy. He recounts the army’s hardships—storms, disease, and a shipwreck that scattered the fleet (caused by divine wrath, he hints). When the Chorus asks about Menelaus, the Herald admits he’s missing, likely lost at sea. Clytemnestra briefly appears, claiming she knew of the victory via the beacons, and orders the Herald to tell Agamemnon she’s been faithful—a lie dripping with irony.
    
-   Key Details: The Herald’s optimism clashes with hints of divine displeasure (e.g., the storm). Clytemnestra’s feigned loyalty heightens tension—she’s laying the trap.
    

## Chorus’s Second Ode: The Price of War (Lines 681–781)

-   Events: The Chorus meditates on Helen, “the face that launched a thousand ships,” calling her a “spirit of ruin.” They lament the war’s cost—grieving widows, orphaned children—and warn of divine jealousy toward mortal pride. They sense something sinister brewing in Argos, though they can’t name it.
    
-   Key Details: The ode ties personal loss to cosmic justice. The Chorus’s growing anxiety mirrors the audience’s as Agamemnon nears.
    

## Agamemnon’s Return (Lines 782–974)

-   Characters: Agamemnon enters in a chariot with Cassandra, his war prize; Clytemnestra greets him; the Chorus observes.
    
-   Events: Agamemnon arrives triumphant, thanking the gods for victory. He mentions Troy’s destruction and the army’s losses but brushes off the storm. Clytemnestra welcomes him with an extravagant speech, claiming she’s been loyal and sleepless with worry. She lays out purple (or red) tapestries for him to walk on, urging him to enter the palace as a conqueror. Agamemnon hesitates, fearing hubris—walking on such finery might offend the gods—but Clytemnestra persuades him. He removes his boots and walks the path, entering the palace. Clytemnestra follows, praying to Zeus to fulfill her “unspoken hopes.”
    
-   Key Details: The tapestry scene is pivotal—symbolizing blood, royalty, and sacrilege. Agamemnon’s reluctant pride seals his doom. Clytemnestra’s double-edged words (“a sea of blood”) hint at her plan. Cassandra, silent so far, remains outside.
    

## Cassandra’s Prophecy (Lines 975–1330)

-   Characters: Cassandra, Clytemnestra (briefly), the Chorus.
    
-   Events: Clytemnestra re-enters, ordering Cassandra inside, but the Trojan princess refuses, staying silent at first. When Clytemnestra leaves, Cassandra erupts into a prophetic frenzy. She foresees Agamemnon’s murder and her own, describing a “net of death” and a “two-footed lioness” (Clytemnestra) with a “wolf” (Aegisthus). She recalls her curse from Apollo—granted foresight, denied belief—and the fall of Troy, linking her fate to Agamemnon’s. The Chorus is horrified but confused, unable to act on her riddles. Cassandra accepts her death, strips off her prophetic robes, and enters the palace willingly.
    
-   Key Details: Cassandra’s scene is the emotional peak—her clarity contrasts with the Chorus’s helplessness. Her visions tie the House of Atreus’s curse (past atrocities like Thyestes’ feast) to the present bloodshed.
    

## The Murder (Lines 1331–1576)

-   Characters: Chorus, Agamemnon (offstage), Clytemnestra, Aegisthus.
    
-   Events: The Chorus debates Cassandra’s words, sensing doom. Suddenly, Agamemnon’s death cries ring out from inside—he’s been struck with an axe. The palace doors open, revealing Clytemnestra standing over the bodies of Agamemnon and Cassandra, entangled in a net. She boasts of her revenge, describing how she trapped and stabbed Agamemnon, her “third blow” a votive offering for Iphigenia. The Chorus recoils, calling her mad, but she defends her act as justice. Aegisthus enters, gloating over Agamemnon’s corpse, revealing his motive: avenging his father Thyestes, whom Atreus (Agamemnon’s father) tricked into eating his own children. The Chorus threatens rebellion, but Aegisthus asserts control, backed by guards.
    
-   Key Details: The net imagery ties Clytemnestra’s cunning to fate’s inescapability. Her exultation—“I stand where I struck”—is chillingly triumphant. Aegisthus’s backstory adds a layer of generational vendetta.
    

## Closing: A New Tyranny (Lines 1577–1673)

-   Events: The Chorus mourns Agamemnon, cursing Clytemnestra and Aegisthus. Clytemnestra justifies her rule, claiming she’ll bring order. Aegisthus taunts the elders, promising to crush dissent. The Chorus predicts further bloodshed—hinting at Orestes, Agamemnon’s son, who’ll return in the next play. Clytemnestra silences both sides, and the new rulers enter the palace as the Chorus disperses in despair.
    
-   Key Details: The ending is unresolved, setting up the Oresteia’s next chapter. Power shifts, but the cycle of vengeance looms.
    

## Final Notes

The play runs about 1,673 lines in the original Greek, typically lasting 90 minutes to two hours in performance. The action is compact—spanning a single day—but layered with backstory and prophecy. Every line drips with irony, from Clytemnestra’s false welcome to Cassandra’s ignored warnings. It’s a slow, deliberate march to a brutal climax, leaving you with questions about justice, guilt, and inevitability. Want me to zoom in on any specific moment?
