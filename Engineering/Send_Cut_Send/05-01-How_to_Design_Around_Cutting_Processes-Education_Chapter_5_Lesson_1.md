## Overview

### Introduction
- Chapter 5 focuses on designing around sheet goods
- Lesson 1 covers key terms about cutting processes
- Builds on previous chapters about taking ideas from brain to CAD to manufacturer

### Fiber Laser Cutting Process
- Two main components: laser and high-pressure gas
- Laser creates molten or vaporized area on material
- High-pressure gas removes the material
- Requires conductive materials (metals only)
- Uses nitrogen or oxygen as shielding gas
- Shielding gas protects the cut area

### Kerf
- The gap or width of the cut between part and scrap
- Not a perpendicular edge due to taper
- Top of cut spends more time in material and is closer to laser source
- Taper must be considered for tolerancing
- Must be offset to achieve correct part dimensions
- If cut directly on line, parts will be oversized

### Kerf Offset
- Half of the kerf width
- Offsets the cutting line to achieve correct dimensions
- SendCutSend handles this automatically
- Customers provide part dimensions, manufacturer applies offset

### Pierce
- Initial penetration through material
- Takes time to create molten area and penetrate fully
- Creates crater-like void that cleans up as it goes through
- For outside geometry: pierce done outside part area
- For internal geometry: pierce done inside part area

### Lead In
- Path from pierce point back to desired cut line
- Leads into the part before cutting begins
- May leave small tab or mark on finished part
- Not always visible on final parts from SendCutSend

### Burr
- Varies by material type, machine, and material thickness
- Forms when vapor and molten material curl around edge and resolidify
- Can be knocked off or sanded
- SendCutSend offers deburring services
- Softer materials tend to have larger burrs
- Thicker materials may have more burr due to less efficient cutting

### Heat Affected Zone (HAZ)
- Area on part that received heat but wasn't removed
- On fiber lasers: almost zero HAZ due to high speed
- Some high hardening materials like 1095 may show slight hardening
- Much smaller than plasma cutting which has large HAZ
- Plasma cutting has large HAZ because it cuts slowly with lots of heat

### Water Jet Cutting
- Uses high-pressure water and abrasive
- Erosion process removes material
- No heat created during cutting
- Has kerf and kerf offset (often larger than fiber laser)
- Requires piercing and lead-ins
- No shielding gas needed
- Minimal burr due to lack of heating/cooling effects
- Any burr usually from last bit of material not fully cut

### CNC Router Cutting
- Uses rotating endmills with flutes
- Takes chunks of material out with each flute
- Has kerf and kerf offset
- Kerf equals diameter of endmill
- Kerf offset equals radius of endmill
- Example: half-inch endmill requires quarter-inch offset
- Smaller geometry changes kerf offset
- Pierce can be done by ramping, plunging, or helical pattern
- Lead-in and lead-out present but less noticeable
- Creates perpendicular cut path (unlike water jet and fiber laser)
- Water jet and fiber laser create angled cuts
- Thicker materials show more taper effect

### Terms
- Kerf - The width of the cut, the gap between the part and scrap material created during the cutting process.
- Kerf Offset - Half of the kerf width, used to offset the cutting line so parts come out to correct dimensions.
- Pierce - The initial penetration through the material where the laser or cutting tool first contacts and creates a void.
- Lead In - The path from the pierce point back to the desired cut line before the actual cutting begins.
- Burr - Material that curls around the edge and resolidifies during cutting, creating a rough edge that can be removed.
- Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) - The area on the part that received heat during cutting but wasn't removed, potentially affecting material properties.
- Shielding Gas - High-pressure gas (nitrogen or oxygen) used in fiber laser cutting to remove molten material and protect the cut area.
- Fiber Laser - A cutting method that uses a laser to create molten material and high-pressure gas to remove it, requiring conductive materials.
- Water Jet - A cutting method using high-pressure water and abrasive to erode material, creating no heat during the process.
- CNC Router - A cutting machine that uses rotating endmills with flutes to remove material in chunks, creating perpendicular cut paths.
- Endmill - A rotating cutting tool with flutes used in CNC routers to remove material.
- Taper - The non-perpendicular angle of the cut edge, more pronounced at the top where more time is spent cutting and closer to the laser source.
