## Basic Principles of Electromagnetism

### Electromagnets
- Wire wrapped around metal core (nail/steel)
- Current creates magnetic field
- Can lift metal objects when energized
- Basic building block for relays and solenoids

### Relays
- Electromagnet with electrical contacts attached
- Small current controls larger current
- Steel armature moves to make/break contacts
- Used for switching circuits

### Solenoids
- Wire wrapped around tube instead of solid core
- Steel slug moves inside tube when energized
- Linear motion instead of rotational
- Used for mechanical actuation

## Applications

### Electromagnetic Locks
- 24 volts, 200 milliamps operation
- Steel wraps around coil for magnetic circuit
- Force decreases rapidly with distance (4th power relationship)
- Very strong when in contact, weak when separated

### Electromagnetic Clutches
- Non-rotating electromagnet magnetizes steel disc
- Steel disc hovers ~0.5mm away when off
- When energized, disc locks to rotating part
- Used in coin-operated machines

### Solenoid History
- Heyday in mid-20th century
- Used in electromechanical contraptions
- Examples: ticket cutters, coin payout mechanisms, car indicators
- Replaced by stepper motors in modern clocks

### Modern Applications
- Car starter motors (meshes gear, completes circuit)
- Computer hard drives (voice coil actuators)
- Loudspeakers (coil moves in magnetic field)
- Solenoid valves (control fluid flow)

## Technical Details

### Solenoid Power Characteristics
- Pulling power decreases with distance
- Force strongest when fully retracted
- Can increase voltage temporarily for more power
- AC solenoids use laminated steel to prevent eddy currents

### Solenoid Valves
- Basic type: solenoid directly opens valve (10 watts)
- Most common: pilot-operated valves
- Small solenoid controls pressure to open main valve
- Used in washing machines and industrial applications

### Relay Types and Uses
- Power relays: small current controls large current (60mA controls 15A)
- Signal relays: isolate digital circuits
- Reed relays: magnetic contacts in sealed capsule
- Solid state relays: no moving parts, longer life

### Contact Arcing
- Problem with inductive loads (motors)
- Can erode contacts over time
- Suppressors available for AC loads
- Solid state relays avoid arcing

### Relay Circuits
- Holding circuits: relay stays on after momentary switch
- Motor braking: short circuit stops motor quickly
- Motor reversing: swap polarity with relay
- Binary to decimal conversion
