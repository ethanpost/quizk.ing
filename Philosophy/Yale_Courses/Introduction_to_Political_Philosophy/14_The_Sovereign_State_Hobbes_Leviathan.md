## Hobbes' Theory of Sovereignty

### The Sovereign State
- Sovereign described as a "mortal god"
- Created as answer to problems of the state of nature
- Endowed with absolute power to end uncertainty and anxiety
- An office rather than a person
- An "artificial person" created by contract/covenant
- Product of art/science, not nature
- Representative of the people
- People endow sovereign with authority
- Resembles modern executive power
- Unlike Louis XIV who claimed "I am the state"
- Sovereign does not own the state but is authorized to secure peace
- Similar to a modern CEO - anonymous and impersonal

### Legal Positivism
- "The law is what the sovereign says it is"
- Similar to Thrasymachus' view in Republic
- No higher court of appeal beyond sovereign's will
- Sovereign as umpire who both enforces and creates rules
- Sovereign can never act unjustly since sovereignty is source of law
- Illustrated with story of David and Uriah
- Distinguishes between just law (sovereign command) and good law (needful for people)
- Purpose of law is to facilitate, not merely control
- Laws are like hedges - keeping people on their way, not stopping them

### Control of Opinion
- Actions proceed from opinions
- Sovereign has right to control what opinions/books are permitted
- Control directed at two institutions: Church and University
- Concerned with radical Puritan sects elevating conscience above law
- Universities teaching Aristotle's republican ideas
- Blamed classics (Aristotle, Cicero) for civil war and regicide
- Sees himself as reformer of ideas and educator of princes
- Hopes his book will be adopted by universities to replace Aristotle

## Hobbesian Liberalism

### Limits on Power
- Despite absolute talk, allows room for individual liberty
- Takes justice and rule of law seriously
- Maintains that no one should be forced to accuse themselves (Fifth Amendment)
- Punishment only for rehabilitation, not revenge
- Advocates for social equality and equal justice
- Proposes equal taxation for all classes
- Supports public assistance for the indigent

### Liberty of the Moderns
- Gives priority to rights over duties
- Distinguishes between ancient and modern liberty
- Ancient liberty: collective freedom in self-governing republics
- Modern liberty: absence of constraints to individual action
- Freedom to act "where the law is silent" 
- Private liberty as "immunity from service"
- Regime judged by how much private freedom it grants individuals

## Hobbes and Modern Society

### Psychological Foundations
- State emerges from struggle between pride and fear
- Fear associated with security, order, rationality
- Pride connected with glory, honor, recognition
- Civilization stems from controlling pride
- The 19 laws of nature promote sociability against pride

### The Hobbesian Citizen
- Fearful, avoids dangerous actions
- Not likely to risk life for liberty or honor
- Plays by rules, avoids dangers, bets on the sure thing
- Called "bourgeois" by later theorists
- Careful, self-interested, risk-averse
- Now the dominant ethos of our civilization

### The Paradox of the Hobbesian State
- Requires individuals willing to risk life for honor
- Needs firefighters, police, soldiers despite self-interest psychology
- Lives in a Hobbesian world of international relations
- No higher authority regulates relations between states
- The "dialectic of the bourgeois and the barbarian"
- Cannot explain why people defend honor when it's irrational
- Modern peace rests on those willing to risk lives for higher goals

### Terms
- Sovereign - The supreme power in a state created by social contract, representing the people and possessing absolute authority to maintain peace and order.
- Legal Positivism - The doctrine that law is what the sovereign commands, with no higher authority than sovereign will.
- State of Nature - The hypothetical condition without government where life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."
- Liberty - For Hobbes, the absence of external impediments to motion; politically, the freedom to act where the law is silent.
- Social Contract - The agreement by which individuals consent to surrender natural rights to a sovereign for protection and peace.
- Leviathan - Hobbes' term for the sovereign state, named after the biblical sea monster; described as "king of the children of pride."
- Laws of Nature - Precepts discovered by reason that forbid self-destructive actions; Hobbes lists 19 such laws.
- Absolutism - The theory that the sovereign must have unlimited, undivided power.
- Pride - The passion for superiority that Hobbes believed led to conflict in the state of nature.
- Fear - The passion that motivates people to seek peace and accept the sovereign's authority.
