## Latin 002 - [Basic English Grammar For Learning Latin Part II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gox0p-gRXBw)

### Basic Sentence Structure
- Grammar knowledge helps in learning new languages
- Especially important for Latin and Romance languages
- Sentence components compared to car parts:
  - Verb = motor/engine (essential component)
  - Nouns = structural parts (body, seats, mirrors)
  - Adjectives = decorative elements (stereo, leather seats, color)

### Types of Verbs
- Transitive Verbs
  - Action flows to another noun
  - Has both subject and direct object
  - "Trans" means "across" in Latin
  - Example: "Student answers phone"
- Intransitive Verbs
  - Action stops at the verb
  - No direct object
  - Example: "Phone rings"
- Linking Verbs
  - Acts like an equals sign
  - Connects two equivalent parts
  - Example: "Julia Caesar is her friend"

### Sentence Components
- Subjects
  - Controls the verb
  - Usually comes before verb in English
  - Found by asking "who/what + verb?"
- Direct Objects
  - Receives the action
  - Only present with transitive verbs
  - Found by asking "whom/what + subject + verb?"

### Important Notes
- Adding prepositional phrases doesn't change verb type
- "Is + -ing" forms are still the main verb type
- All verbs must have subjects
- Not all verbs have direct objects

### Terms
- Transitive Verb - A verb that carries action to a direct object
- Intransitive Verb - A verb that does not carry action to a direct object
- Linking Verb - A verb that connects two equivalent parts of a sentence
- Subject - The doer of the action in a sentence
- Direct Object - The receiver of the action in a transitive verb
- Prepositional Phrase - A phrase that shows location, time, or manner
