### History
- 18th century gentlemen scientists experimented with static electricity
- Michael Faraday invented the first DC motor in 1822
- Anos Jedlik, a Benedictine Hungarian monk, made the first recognizable electric motor in 1827
- Early motors used mercury as a conductor
- First motors had four electromagnets, later replaced outer ones with permanent magnets

### Basic Principles
- Electricity flowing through wire creates magnetic effects
- Wire becomes magnetic when current flows through it
- Wire also becomes hot when current flows (can be problematic)
- Electromagnetic effects are useful for motors
- Commutator reverses polarity to keep motor rotating
- Modern motors use permanent magnets shaped to fit closely to armature

### Basic Properties
- DC motors have extraordinarily large size range
- Small motors have fewer coils and commutator segments
- Large motors have many segments and coils (40+ segments)
- Motors are easy to reverse by swapping terminals
- Motors have preferred direction due to brush positioning
- Motors can work at various speeds below rated voltage
- Motors can work as generators when spun

### Back EMF (Electromagnetic Force)
- Motors simultaneously act as generators
- Generated electricity opposes input voltage
- Reduces current draw at full speed
- When motor slows down, back EMF reduces, allowing more current
- Provides high starting torque
- Only takes current needed for load

### Starting Current
- High starting torque requires high starting current
- Need power supplies rated for starting current (5-10 amps)
- Require thick wires for high current
- Use thermal fuses and circuit breakers for protection
- Slow-blow fuses allow high current briefly for starting

### Braking
- Back EMF can be used for braking
- Connect motor terminals together to create braking circuit
- Motor generates current that acts to slow it down
- Provides rapid stopping compared to coasting

### Speed Control
- Reduce speed with diodes (0.7V drop per diode)
- Modern speed controllers use pulse width modulation
- Chop current on/off, ratio determines speed
- Gearboxes provide mechanical speed reduction

### Gearboxes
- Worm gears reduce motor depth and provide 90-degree direction change
- Provide mechanical lock (motor won't turn when pushed)
- Spur gears with multiple stages for speed reduction
- Epicyclic gears are compact and quiet
- Load shared between planetary gears

### Torque
- Measured as distance times force (Newton meters)
- Breakaway torque is starting torque
- Motor specifications include rated torque
- Torque varies with distance from pivot point

### Motor Types
- Windshield wiper motors: common, have gearboxes, bronze bush bearings
- Miniature motors: Maxon and Faulhaber (German, high quality), Chinese (cheaper, variable quality)
- AC motors: induction motors, three-phase and single-phase
- Stepper motors: move in discrete steps, require drivers
- Brushless DC motors: electronically controlled, no brushes
- Servo motors: have encoders for position feedback

### Brush Wear
- Brushes rubbing on commutator wear away over time
- Continuous operation lasts about 5 years
- Not suitable for continuous operation
- AC motors better for continuous use

### Terms
- Armature - The rotating part of a motor containing coils
- Back EMF - Electromagnetic force generated by motor that opposes input voltage
- Brushes - Springy metal strips that contact the commutator
- Commutator - Ring that reverses current polarity to keep motor rotating
- DC Motor - Direct current motor using permanent magnets and coils
- Electromagnet - Coil of wire that becomes magnetic when current flows
- Generator - Device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy
- Induction Motor - AC motor that uses rotating magnetic field
- Permanent Magnet - Magnet that maintains its magnetic field
- Rotor - The rotating part of a motor
- Stator - The stationary part of a motor containing magnets or coils
- Stepper Motor - Motor that moves in discrete steps
- Torque - Rotational force measured as distance times force
- Worm Gear - Gear that provides 90-degree direction change and mechanical lock
