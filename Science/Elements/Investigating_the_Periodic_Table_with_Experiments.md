## History of the Periodic Table
- 2019 is the International Year of the Periodic Table (150th anniversary of Mendeleev's table)
- Mendeleev published his version in 1869
- Earlier versions existed (7 years before Mendeleev's)
- Mendeleev's table arranged similar elements in vertical columns
- Modern periodic table maintains this arrangement

## Atomic Structure
- Atoms consist of three components:
  - Positively charged protons (in nucleus)
  - Neutrons with no charge (in nucleus)
  - Negatively charged electrons (orbiting nucleus)
- Neutral atoms have equal numbers of protons and electrons
- Atomic number = number of protons in nucleus
- Elements arranged in periodic table by increasing atomic number

## Organization of the Periodic Table
- Elements with similar properties arranged in vertical groups
- Similar properties result from similar electron configurations
- Group 1 (alkali metals): one electron in outermost shell
- Group 2 (alkaline earth metals): two electrons in outermost shell
- Group 13/3: three electrons in outermost shell
- Group 14/4: four electrons in outermost shell
- Group 15/5: five electrons in outermost shell
- Group 16/6: six electrons in outermost shell
- Group 17 (halogens): seven electrons in outermost shell
- Group 18 (noble gases): full outer electron shell

## Group 1 Elements (Alkali Metals)
- Include hydrogen, lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, francium
- All have one electron in outermost shell
- React vigorously with water
- Form oxides with formula M₂O (two metal atoms, one oxygen)
- Float on water (less dense than water)
- Increasingly reactive down the group
- Form alkaline solutions when reacted with water

## Group 2 Elements (Alkaline Earth Metals)
- Include beryllium, magnesium, calcium
- All have two electrons in outermost shell
- Form oxides with formula MO (one metal atom, one oxygen)
- Sink in water (more dense than water)
- Calcium reacts with water more vigorously than magnesium
- Form alkaline solutions when reacted with water

## Group 17 Elements (Halogens)
- Include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, astatine, tennessine
- Very reactive elements
- Known as "salt makers" (form salts with metals)
- Physical states vary: gases (F, Cl), liquid (Br), solid (I)
- Distinctive colors and properties:
  - Chlorine: toxic green-yellow gas
  - Bromine: dark brown liquid with choking smell
  - Iodine: violet solid/vapor

## Group 18 Elements (Noble Gases)
- Include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, radon, oganesson
- Last group to be discovered (not in Mendeleev's original table)
- Extremely unreactive (inert)
- Exist as individual atoms (don't form molecules)
- All are gases at room temperature (except possibly oganesson)
- Argon is the third most abundant gas in atmosphere (1%)

## Mendeleev's Contributions
- Left gaps in his table for undiscovered elements
- Predicted properties of unknown elements
- Predictions for scandium (ekaboron) were accurate
- Organized elements by how they react with oxygen
- Recognized patterns in oxide formulas across periods

## Chemical Reactions with Oxygen
- Group 1 elements form oxides with formula M₂O
- Group 2 elements form oxides with formula MO
- Group 13/3 elements form oxides with formula M₂O₃
- Group 14/4 elements form oxides with formula MO₂ or M₂O₄
- Group 15/5 elements form oxides with formula M₂O₃ or M₂O₅
- Group 16/6 elements form oxides with formula MO₂ or MO₃
- Oxide acidity increases across periods:
  - Group 1 & 2 oxides form alkaline solutions
  - Group 14+ oxides form acidic solutions

## Bonding and Physical Properties
- Metals form bonds using their outermost electrons
- Bond strength increases with number of available electrons
- Carbon forms very strong bonds (4 electrons)
- Bond strength affects melting/boiling points
- Noble gases don't form bonds between atoms

## Terms
- Periodic Table - A tabular arrangement of chemical elements organized by atomic number and electron configuration, showing periodic trends in properties.
- Atomic Number - The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, which determines its chemical identity.
- Element - A pure chemical substance consisting of atoms with the same number of protons.
- Proton - A positively charged subatomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom.
- Neutron - A subatomic particle with no electric charge found in the nucleus of an atom.
- Electron - A negatively charged subatomic particle that orbits the nucleus of an atom.
- Group - A vertical column in the periodic table containing elements with similar chemical properties.
- Period - A horizontal row in the periodic table representing elements with the same number of electron shells.
- Alkali Metals - Elements in Group 1 of the periodic table (except hydrogen) characterized by high reactivity and one valence electron.
- Alkaline Earth Metals - Elements in Group 2 of the periodic table characterized by two valence electrons.
- Halogens - Highly reactive nonmetal elements in Group 17 of the periodic table.
- Noble Gases - Extremely unreactive elements in Group 18 of the periodic table with full outer electron shells.
- Oxide - A compound formed when an element combines with oxygen.
- Thermite Reaction - A highly exothermic reaction between aluminum and iron oxide that produces molten iron.
