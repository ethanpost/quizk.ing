## Outline

### Jet Engine Operation
- Turbofan engines use a large fan at the front
- During takeoff, the fan pushes 1.3 tons of air backwards every second
- About 10% of incoming air gets compressed, 90% bypasses the engine core
- Compressors force air into narrow chambers, compressing it to about 50 times atmospheric pressure
- Compression heats air to around 600 degrees Celsius
- Compressed air enters combustion chamber where fuel is sprayed and ignited
- Combustion raises temperature to around 1,500 degrees Celsius
- High-pressure gas expands through turbine blades, transferring energy to spin them
- Each high-pressure turbine blade generates as much power as a Formula 1 car during takeoff
- There are 68 high-pressure turbine blades
- Turbine blades spin at 12,500 revolutions per minute
- Gas pressure drops from 50 atmospheres to one as it expands almost 20 times
- Turbines power the fan and compressors at the front
- Hot exhaust gas generates less than 20% of thrust in modern passenger jets
- Over 80% of thrust comes from the fan pushing bypass air backwards
- The fan acts like a huge ducted propeller

### Engine Efficiency
- Modern jets have large fans to push more air backwards with smaller velocity changes
- Bypass air surrounds hot exhaust gases, reducing noise
- Engine efficiency depends on temperature difference between hot gas and cold outside air
- At cruising altitude (35,000 feet), outside air is around -55 degrees Celsius
- Inside engine, temperature is over 1,500 degrees Celsius
- Carnot efficiency = 1 - (cold temperature / hot temperature)
- Efficiency can be improved by flying where air is colder or raising combustion temperature
- Fighter jets compress all air but are inefficient
- Kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared, so slower-moving larger air masses are more efficient

### The Harsh Environment
- Jet engines run at temperatures 250 degrees Celsius hotter than the melting point of their materials
- Turbine blades operate in gas over 1,500 degrees Celsius
- Blade tips slice through air at nearly 1,900 kilometers per hour
- Each 300-gram high-pressure turbine blade experiences centripetal force equal to 20 metric tons
- That's roughly the weight of two London double-decker buses tugging on each blade
- Oxygen wants to react with metal blades at these temperatures
- Air carries dust, sand, and pollutants that can damage and erode surfaces
- Blades must survive tens of thousands of flight hours without deforming, cracking, or failing
- Turbine blades determine maximum combustion temperature and engine efficiency

### Material Testing
- Mild steel was tested but deforms at high temperatures
- Elastic deformation: material returns to original size when load is removed
- Plastic deformation: material changes shape permanently
- Strain: per-unit change in length when material is under stress
- At high temperatures, bonds break and reform as metal deforms permanently
- Edge dislocation: an extra half-plane of atoms in a crystal structure
- Dislocations move through the lattice, causing planes to shear past each other
- Creep: continuous deformation under constant load at high temperature
- As temperature increases, dislocations move more easily and metal gets softer
- Titanium is about half as dense as steel but also loses strength at high temperatures
- Most metals lose strength as temperature increases

### Early Jet Engines
- First jet engine designed by British pilot and engineer Frank Whittle in 1941
- Powered first flight of British jet aircraft, the Gloster E.28/39 prototype
- Used steel turbine blades
- Gas inside engine only reached around 780 degrees Celsius
- Engine could only fly for up to 10 hours before parts would fail
- Both drawbacks were largely due to steel turbine blades

### Nickel Superalloys
- First nickel alloys developed in 1940s by adding chromium and cobalt
- Could handle 800-900 degrees Celsius, about 100 degrees hotter than steel
- Could keep strength for thousands of hours, a tenfold improvement
- Breakthrough came when aluminum was added
- Nickel superalloys get stronger at certain temperatures (around 800 degrees)
- Microstructure looks like a city grid with blocks and rods
- Each block is so small, over 300 would line up across width of a human hair
- Gamma phase: aluminum and nickel can take any spot, no repeating sequence
- Gamma prime phase: aluminum always at corners, nickel at faces, perfect repeating pattern
- Dislocations move easily through gamma phase but get stuck in gamma prime phase
- Super dislocations: dislocations must travel in pairs through gamma prime
- Cross-slip: dislocations can slip to different planes at high temperatures
- When dislocations cross-slip, they separate and get locked in place
- Nickel superalloy strength peaks at certain temperature due to cross-slip
- Too much gamma prime makes material brittle
- Need balance between gamma prime (strength) and gamma (ductility)
- Aluminum oxide forms protective layer on surface at high temperatures
- Modern superalloys contain as many as 10 different elements
- Chromium improves resistance to oxidation and corrosion
- Cobalt, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and vanadium stabilize gamma prime phase
- Molybdenum and iron strengthen gamma matrix
- Rhenium has melting point of 3,180 degrees Celsius, second only to tungsten
- Rhenium slows atomic-scale rearrangements, enhancing resistance to deformation above 1,000 degrees Celsius
- Rhenium is one of rarest elements in Earth's crust at less than one part per billion
- More than 80% of mined rhenium ends up in jet engines

### Crystal Structure
- Metals are crystalline, made up of millions of little crystals stuck together
- Grain boundaries are weak points between crystals
- Grain boundaries have more open spaces, broken bonds, defects, vacancies, and impurities
- Atoms move more easily along grain boundaries (super highways for atomic diffusion)
- At high temperatures with stress, grains can slide past each other
- Structure deforms like warm taffy
- As long as material has grains, it will creep and fail more easily

### Making Turbine Blades
- Investment casting is ancient technology, perfected for turbine blades
- Process starts with wax patterns
- Ceramic core creates hollow inside turbine blade
- Wax assembly must be perfect because wax becomes the blade
- Shell is built around wax using zircon-based system
- Primary slurry is thin like light syrup or thin honey
- Backup layers use thicker slurry like treacle and coarser sand
- Four to six backup layers create strong mold
- Wax is melted out and mold is fired
- Molten nickel alloy is poured into ceramic mold
- Mold is mounted vertically and heated to same temperature as melt
- Mold fills from root up toward tip
- Copper chill plate at bottom has grooves that act as nucleation points
- Entire mold is slowly lowered out of hot zone for directional solidification
- Process takes hours
- Casting temperatures are roughly 1,500 degrees Celsius
- Directionally solidified blades have columnar crystals running along blade axis
- Columnar crystals make blade significantly stronger than separate crystals
- Pigtail: helical passage at bottom of mold that selects single crystal
- Spiral chokes out every other grain except one
- Single crystal grows through entirety of blade
- Blade is heated again almost to melting point to form final microstructure
- Crystal orientation is of paramount significance
- Over 95% of blades can be cast successfully as single crystals
- Went from 50,000 crystal grains down to just one
- Solidification front looks like forest of tiny tree-like branches called dendrites
- Up to 10 elements in alloy, each with own density and melting point
- Final crystal comprised of more than 6 × 10^24 atoms
- That's more atoms than stars in observable universe
- Single-crystal blades last up to nine times longer against creep and thermal fatigue
- More than three times more resistant to corrosion than multi-grain blades
- Modern jet engines can run for 25,000 hours between major overhauls
- Between 1960 and 2010, jet aircraft became about 55% more fuel efficient
- Huge part of improvement comes from advances in nickel superalloys

### Cooling Systems
- Blades have hollow passages inside created by ceramic cores
- Cores are leached out using caustic solution of potassium-sodium hydroxide
- Passages have intentional ridges to trip flow and create turbulence
- Turbulent flow removes much more heat from blade surface
- Film cooling: holes drilled into cooling passages
- Cooling air comes from high-pressure compressor at around 600 degrees Celsius
- Air blows as film over blade surface, preventing metal from melting
- Can't use too much cooling air because it reduces thrust and efficiency
- Two protective coating layers on each blade
- Metallic bond coat resists oxidation
- Ceramic topcoat is about quarter of a millimeter thick
- Ceramic coating keeps metal 100 to 170 degrees cooler
- This is final barrier that stops blades from melting

### Dust and Sand Problems
- At 36,000 feet, there's dirt and dust in atmosphere that engines ingest
- Dirt and dust sticks on blades and goes through cooling circuit
- Dust clogs cooling passages, preventing cooling from reaching blades
- Blades then burn up
- When dust hits turbine blades in hot section, it melts and sticks
- Molten dust slowly rips layers of thermal barrier coating off
- Loss of coating reduces temperature reduction
- Nickel alloy underneath gets hotter and deteriorates
- Engineers developing new ceramic coatings to resist mold and dust
- New coatings can extend turbine life by up to 30%

### Impact and Significance
- Blades operate right at edge of what is physically possible
- Always on knife-edge, pushing every material and process to limit
- Engines run hotter than their own melting point
- Every day, these machines carry millions of people across the world
- Monument to human ingenuity
- Example of refusing to accept limits, turning impossible into routine

## Master Answer Key

**Question 1: A) 10%** - Only 10% of incoming air gets compressed in a turbofan engine. The other 90% bypasses the engine core and is propelled backwards by the fan, generating most of the thrust.

**Question 2: B) False** - The hot exhaust gas accounts for less than 20% of thrust. Over 80% comes from the fan pushing bypass air backwards.

**Question 3: C) 1,500 degrees Celsius** - The combustion chamber reaches around 1,500 degrees Celsius when fuel is ignited, which is 250 degrees hotter than the melting point of the materials.

**Question 4: A) As much as a Formula 1 car** - Each high-pressure turbine blade generates as much power as a Formula 1 car during takeoff, and there are 68 of them.

**Question 5: C) 1 - (cold temperature / hot temperature)** - Carnot efficiency shows the maximum efficiency possible for a heat engine based on the temperature difference between hot and cold reservoirs.

**Question 6: A) True** - Jet engines operate at temperatures 250 degrees Celsius hotter than the melting point of their materials, which is why cooling systems are so critical.

**Question 7: C) Equal to the weight of 20 metric tons** - A 300-gram blade experiences centripetal force equal to 20 metric tons, roughly the weight of two London double-decker buses.

**Question 8: B) Strain** - Strain is the per-unit change in length when a material is under stress, measuring how much the material deforms.

**Question 9: A) True** - Elastic deformation is temporary and reversible. When the load is removed, the material returns to its original size.

**Question 10: B) An extra half-plane of atoms in a crystal structure** - Edge dislocations are defects in the crystal structure where an extra half-plane of atoms creates a line defect that allows the material to deform.

**Question 11: C) Creep** - Creep is the continuous, time-dependent deformation that occurs under constant load at high temperatures, which is a major concern for turbine blades.

**Question 12: A) Frank Whittle** - British pilot and engineer Frank Whittle designed the first jet engine in 1941, which powered the first British jet aircraft.

**Question 13: A) True** - Early jet engines with steel turbine blades could only fly for up to 10 hours before parts would fail, limiting their practicality.

**Question 14: D) Aluminum** - Adding aluminum to nickel alloys was the breakthrough that created the gamma prime phase, dramatically improving strength at high temperatures.

**Question 15: A) Structure where aluminum and nickel can take any spot with no repeating sequence** - The gamma phase has a random arrangement where atoms can occupy any position without a repeating pattern.

**Question 16: C) Structure where aluminum always at corners and nickel at faces with perfect repeating pattern** - The gamma prime phase has an ordered structure that traps dislocations and provides strength.

**Question 17: B) False** - Dislocations move easily through the gamma phase but get stuck in the gamma prime phase, which is what makes the alloy strong.

**Question 18: C) Pairs of dislocations that must travel together through gamma prime phase** - Super dislocations are pairs that work together to move through the ordered gamma prime structure, requiring much higher stress.

**Question 19: C) They separate and get locked in place** - At high temperatures, dislocations can cross-slip to different planes, separating the pairs and locking them in place, which actually increases strength.

**Question 20: C) It becomes brittle** - Too much gamma prime makes the material too strong and brittle, so a balance is needed between gamma (ductility) and gamma prime (strength).

**Question 32: C) About 50,000** - Early turbine blades contained on the order of 50,000 crystal grains, which created many weak grain boundaries.

**Question 33: A) True** - Single-crystal blades last up to nine times longer against creep and thermal fatigue because they have no grain boundaries to fail along.

**Question 34: D) 25,000 hours** - Modern jet engines can run for 25,000 hours between major overhauls, something unthinkable before single-crystal blades.

**Question 35: C) About 55%** - Between 1960 and 2010, jet aircraft became about 55% more fuel efficient, largely due to advances in nickel superalloys and blade technology.

**Question 36: C) Technique where cooling air is blown through holes to create protective film over blade surface** - Film cooling creates a protective layer of cooler air over the blade surface to prevent melting.

**Question 37: A) True** - The cooling air comes from the high-pressure compressor at around 600 degrees Celsius, which is still cool enough to help prevent melting.

**Question 38: B) About a quarter of a millimeter** - The ceramic topcoat is only about a quarter of a millimeter thick but provides crucial protection.

**Question 39: C) 100 to 170 degrees** - The ceramic coating can keep the metal 100 to 170 degrees cooler than it would otherwise be, which is the final barrier preventing melting.

**Question 40: C) They melt and stick to blades, clogging cooling passages** - At high altitudes, dust and dirt melt when they hit the hot turbine blades, sticking to them and clogging the cooling passages, which can cause blades to burn up.

**Question 41: A) True** - Engineers are developing new ceramic coatings designed to resist mold and dust, which can extend turbine life by up to 30%.

**Question 42: B) A type of jet engine with a large fan at the front that pushes most air around the engine core** - Turbofan engines use a large fan to push most air around the core, making them more efficient than older designs.

**Question 43: C) Component that forces air into increasingly narrow chambers, compressing it and heating it** - Compressors squeeze air to about 50 times atmospheric pressure, heating it to around 600 degrees Celsius.

**Question 44: C) Where fuel is sprayed and ignited, raising air temperature to around 1,500 degrees Celsius** - The combustion chamber is where fuel mixes with compressed air and ignites, creating the extreme temperatures needed for power.

**Question 45: A) True** - Turbine blades extract energy from the expanding hot gas to spin the turbines, which power the fan and compressors at the front.

**Question 46: C) The 90% of incoming air that goes around the engine core, propelled backwards by the fan** - Bypass air generates over 80% of thrust by being pushed backwards around the engine core.

**Question 47: C) The forward force generated by pushing air backwards** - Thrust is the reaction force that pushes the engine (and plane) forward when air is pushed backwards.

**Question 48: C) Maximum efficiency of a heat engine, equal to 1 minus (cold temperature / hot temperature)** - Carnot efficiency is the theoretical maximum efficiency based on temperature difference between hot and cold reservoirs.

**Question 49: A) True** - Centripetal force is the inward force required to keep an object moving in a circular path, which is enormous for spinning turbine blades.

**Question 50: B) Temporary change in material size that returns to original when load is removed** - Elastic deformation is reversible, like stretching a spring, and doesn't permanently change the material.

**Question 51: B) Permanent change in material shape** - Plastic deformation permanently changes the shape of the material, which is what we want to avoid in turbine blades.

**Question 52: B) The per-unit change in length when material is under stress** - Strain measures how much a material stretches or compresses relative to its original length.

**Question 53: A) True** - An edge dislocation is a line defect in the crystal structure where an extra half-plane of atoms creates a discontinuity.

**Question 54: B) Continuous deformation under constant load at high temperature** - Creep is the slow, continuous deformation that occurs over time at high temperatures, even under constant load.

**Question 55: C) Crystal structure where aluminum and nickel atoms can take any spot, no repeating sequence** - The gamma phase has a random, disordered arrangement that allows dislocations to move easily.

**Question 56: C) Crystal structure where aluminum always at corners and nickel at faces, perfect repeating pattern** - The gamma prime phase has an ordered structure that traps dislocations and provides strength.

**Question 57: A) True** - Super dislocations are pairs that must work together to move through the ordered gamma prime structure, requiring much higher stress.

**Question 58: C) When dislocations slip to different planes at high temperatures** - Cross-slip allows dislocations to move to different planes, which can separate pairs and lock them in place.

**Question 59: B) The interface between different crystal grains in a metal** - Grain boundaries are where different crystal orientations meet, creating weak points with defects.

**Question 60: C) Ancient casting technique using wax patterns to create complex metal shapes** - Investment casting has been used for millennia but has been perfected for making turbine blades.

**Question 61: A) True** - Directional solidification controls how crystals grow, allowing engineers to create columnar or single-crystal structures.
