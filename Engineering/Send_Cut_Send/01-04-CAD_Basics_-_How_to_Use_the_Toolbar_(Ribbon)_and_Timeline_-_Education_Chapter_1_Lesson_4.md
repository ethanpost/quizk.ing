# CAD Basics - How to Use the Toolbar (Ribbon) and Timeline - Education Chapter 1 Lesson 4

## Outline

### Introduction to Toolbar Navigation
- One of the most difficult parts of starting CAD is knowing where tools are located
- Focus on navigating the toolbar, also known as a ribbon
- Toolbar and ribbon are interchangeable terms used throughout lessons

### Toolbar/Ribbon Structure
- Located in the top left corner of Fusion interface
- Contains main menus: Create, Automate, Modify, Assemble
- Features tabs above main menus: Solid, Surface, Mesh, Sheet Metal
- These tabs represent different tool drawers within the toolbox

### Create Menu and Sketch Tools
- Under Create in the Solid tab, users find "Create Sketch"
- Hovering over tools shows quick dialogue descriptions
- Important homework: read and understand tool descriptions
- Tools include: Create Sketch, Extrude, Revolve, Sweep
- Some tools appear both in dropdown menus and pre-selected in ribbon

### Toolbar Customization
- Three dots in corner allow toolbar manipulation
- "Pin to toolbar" feature adds frequently used tools for quick access
- Create Sketch is recommended to pin since it's the first step for any part
- Pin shortcuts allow creation of keyboard shortcuts for common tools

### Sketch Mode and Tool Availability
- When not actively sketching, sketch tools are not visible
- Missing tools include: circles, lines, dimensions, constraints
- Once "Create Sketch" is activated and a plane is selected, a new "Sketch" tab appears
- Sketch tab reveals all previously missing tools: lines, circles, constraints, inspection tools
- Sketch palette appears on the right side of the interface

### Common Mistake: Lost Tools
- Common error: users don't understand where sketch tools went
- Tools disappear when users accidentally click "Finish Sketch"
- Two locations for "Finish Sketch": bottom and top of interface
- When sketch is finished, the tab disappears and sketch is logged in history
- Sketch palette and tools are no longer visible

### Reopening Sketches
- Two methods to reopen sketches and restore tools:
  1. Browser/Tree method: Drop down menu to sketch, right-click, select "Edit Sketch"
  2. Timeline method: Use timeline in bottom left corner

### Timeline/Roadmap Functionality
- Located in bottom left corner of CAD interface
- Contains play button, rewind, and fast forward buttons
- Shows history of all actions performed to create the current model
- Allows navigation through entire creation process

### Timeline Navigation Methods
- Click rewind button for options: "Move to Previous Step", "Move to Beginning", "Move to End"
- Click and drag timeline marker to specific points in history
- Moving marker before a sketch makes it disappear from tree (as if it never existed)
- Moving marker back restores sketch and tools

### Timeline Benefits
- Primary use: editing parts and changing features in background
- Essential for fixing broken parts or correcting references
- Allows corrections without starting completely from scratch
- Becomes more valuable with complex parts containing multiple features and sketches

### Terms
- **Toolbar/Ribbon** – The interface element containing CAD tools, located in the top left corner
- **Create Sketch** – The first step in building any part or feature in Autodesk Fusion
- **Sketch Tab** – Appears when actively sketching, contains drawing tools like lines, circles, and constraints
- **Sketch Palette** – Panel that appears on the right side when in sketch mode
- **Timeline/Roadmap** – History interface in bottom left corner showing all actions performed to create the current model
- **Pin to Toolbar** – Feature that adds frequently used tools to the main toolbar for quick access
- **Finish Sketch** – Command that completes sketching and hides sketch tools
- **Edit Sketch** – Command that reopens a completed sketch to restore sketch tools
