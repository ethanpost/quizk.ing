### Helium as a Resource
- Not renewable on human timescale
- Created by radioactive decay deep underground
- Should be managed like a fossil fuel
- Once dispersed in atmosphere, extremely expensive to recover
- Eventually escapes into space due to being light and unreactive

### National Helium Reserve
- Located in Amarillo, Texas
- Sits atop Bush Dome reservoir
- Reservoir is approximately 3,500 feet underground
- Porous rock stores helium like a sponge holds water
- Originally a natural gas reservoir that was depleted
- Recharged in the 1960s with 32 billion cubic feet of helium
- Program intended to conserve helium for about 100 years

### Extraction and Processing
- Helium stored underground doesn't leak out
- Annual maintenance period for the plant
- Enrichment unit processes the gas
- Extracted gas has mixed with natural gas
- Processing increases purity to approximately 80% helium, 20% nitrogen
- Sent through a 425-mile pipeline to private helium plants
- Private plants further purify to 100%

### Supply and Demand
- Still approximately 80-100 years of known helium reserves in the US
- New helium sources being discovered
- Rising prices have stimulated exploration
- Expected that shortage will be alleviated in coming years
- "Running out" means price rises until supply meets lower demand
- Price fluctuations affect researchers' ability to fund experiments
- Party balloon filling becoming more expensive

### Privatization
- Facility in final years of operation as government entity
- By 2021, will transfer helium activity to private entities
- Conservation efforts have increased helium availability
- Party balloons represent a small part of the market

### Terms
- Bush Dome - The underground reservoir that serves as the storage facility for the National Helium Reserve, located about 3,500 feet underground in Amarillo, Texas.
- Enrichment Unit - Equipment that processes the helium gas extracted from the ground to increase its purity to approximately 80%.
- Helium Reserve - A government-maintained stockpile of helium gas stored underground for future use.
- Privatization - The process of transferring government-controlled helium operations to private companies.
- Conservation - Efforts to reduce helium usage and waste to extend the availability of existing supplies.
