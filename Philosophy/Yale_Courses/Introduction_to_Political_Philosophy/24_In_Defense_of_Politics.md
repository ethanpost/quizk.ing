### Bernard Crick's View of Politics
- Politics as a distinctive human activity
- Conflicts of interests adjudicated through discussion and debate rather than force
- Political society operates with agreed-upon rules for conflict resolution
- Crick defended politics against distortions like Soviet ideology and unreflective conservatism

### Classical Views of Patriotism
- Patriotism seen as an ennobling sentiment in classical philosophy
- Influential thinkers (Cicero, Burke, Machiavelli, Rousseau, Lincoln) provided reasons for love of country
- Historically, political philosophy taught citizens reasons to love their country
- Res publica (the republic) was the proper locus of citizens' loyalty

### Modern Attitudes Toward Patriotism
- Patriotism still common in everyday American life (flags, bumper stickers, country music)
- Skepticism toward patriotism in academic and educated circles
- Samuel Johnson's quote that "patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel" often cited
- E.M. Forster's false dilemma between betraying country or friend

### Concepts of Loyalty
- Loyalty as a moral habit, betrayal as a moral vice
- Case of Cambridge spies (Philby, Maclean, Burgess) who betrayed both country and each other
- Aristotle's approach: virtues as a mean between excess and deficiency
- Patriotism as a potential virtue balanced between extremes

### Carl Schmitt's Nationalism
- Politics defined by the friend/enemy distinction
- War and preparation for war as the inescapable condition of political life
- The political as "the most intense and extreme antagonism"
- Rejection of humanitarian appeals, human rights as avoiding fundamental conflict
- Politics viewed as endless struggle for power guided by national self-interest

### Immanuel Kant's Cosmopolitanism
- Moral duties that respect no national or political boundaries
- No greater moral obligations to fellow citizens than to any human beings
- Citizenship viewed as an arbitrary accident of birth
- Emphasis on universality and equal moral value for all humans
- Vision of perpetual peace through confederation of republics under international law
- Influenced development of League of Nations and United Nations

### Critique of Both Extremes
- Schmitt's view makes politics identical with war
- Logic of Schmitt's conflict extends to civil war within states
- Kant's view confuses politics with morality
- Cosmopolitanism is naive about enforcement of international norms
- Kant's logic leads to world government, which he admitted would be a "soulless despotism"
- Both views contain partial truths but are incomplete

### The American Synthesis
- American regime combines elements of both universal and particular
- Founded on universal principles ("all men are created equal")
- Commitment to universal moral principles (Paine's "revolution in principles")
- Embedded in particular history, constitution, and way of life
- Requires immersion in both philosophy and political history

### The Current State of Political Education
- Universities failing to teach proper understanding of politics
- History departments often critical of tradition rather than respectful
- Political science reduced to game theory and rational choice
- Value neutrality approaching nihilism
- Need for civic-minded education rather than detached observation

### Path Forward for Political Education
- Reading "old books" as the best teachers
- Recommended reading: Plato's Laws, Machiavelli's Discourses, Montesquieu, The Federalist Papers
- Study of American statesmen (Jefferson, Madison, Lincoln, Wilson, Roosevelt)
- Study of jurisprudential thinkers (Marshall, Holmes, Brandeis, Frankfurter)
- Examination of world statesmen (Pericles to Churchill)

### Terms

- Friend/enemy distinction - Schmitt's fundamental political categories that define groups in opposition to each other
- Kingdom of ends - Kant's concept of a universal moral community where every individual has equal moral value
- Nationalism - An excessive form of patriotism that holds absolute attachment to one's country as unconditionally good
- Nihilism - The philosophical disposition that our deepest principles and convictions are nothing more than blind preferences
- Political history - The study of how constitutions and fundamental laws shape citizens and their choices
