## How to Improve Edge Quality with Tumbling and Deburring

### Introduction
- Cleaning up laser cut parts can be a tedious process
- Two main ways to improve the feel of parts: tumbling and linear deburring
- Burrs are created on the back side of laser cuts from undercut or softer material resolidifying

### Tumbling
- Definition: A process using media (ceramic, plastic, or others) placed in a large drum with parts
- How it works: Erosion process similar to river rocks being smoothed by water
- Media characteristics:
  - Different grits or cutting edges
  - Different shapes and sizes
  - Affects speed and finish (coarse to polished)
- Process duration: 15 minutes to several hours depending on machine, media, and desired finish
- Effects:
  - Softens edges
  - Breaks off burr (easier on softer materials like aluminum, harder on materials like AR steel)
  - Creates slightly rolled edge on outer and internal surfaces
  - Size limitations: Media size determines minimum hole size that can be deburred (e.g., 40 thou diameter hole may not be rolled if media can't fit inside)
- Finish quality:
  - Not a perfect show-ready finish
  - Good cosmetic finish that looks stone ground
  - Uniform to a degree but won't remove deep scratches
  - Feels good in hand
  - Ready for secondary processes like anodizing or powder coating

### Linear Deburring
- Important distinction: Linear deburring does NOT mean linear graining
- Graining vs. deburring: Graining is a true finished product; deburring only removes slag from outer surface
- Definition: Essentially running parts through a belt sander
- Setup types:
  - Wet setup
  - Dry setup (typically for steel to avoid corrosive, rusting effects)
  - Choice dictated by manufacturer based on material type
- How it works:
  - Parts fed through by rollers
  - Belt grinds away top surface
  - Removes anything sticking up proud of the material
- Effects:
  - Removes outer edge burr from laser cutting
  - Semi-cosmetic but not perfect (may still see blemishes)
  - Does NOT roll the edge (results in sharper, coarser edge)
  - Only removes outer crust from laser cutting process
- Size limitations:
  - Minimum length: Part must stay in contact with rollers entire time (if too short, part gets eaten up by belt)
  - Maximum width: Limited by belt width
  - Different machines allow different part sizes
  - Manufacturers like SendCutSend have minimum length requirements

### Process Considerations
- Both tumbling and linear deburring are options through secondary processes
- Selecting these options increases lead time
- Adds additional cost
- Both provide better finished, sales-ready parts
- Important: These are deburring processes, not finishing processes

### Terms
- Tumbling - A deburring process where parts are placed in a drum with media (ceramic, plastic, or others) and turned over repeatedly, creating an erosion process that smooths edges and removes burrs.
- Linear deburring - A process that runs parts through a belt sander to remove slag and burrs from the outer surface of laser-cut parts, creating a semi-cosmetic finish.
- Burr - Rough material created on the back side of laser cuts from undercut or softer material coming through and resolidifying.
- Media - Materials (ceramic, plastic, or others) used in tumbling that have different grits or cutting edges to smooth parts through erosion.
- Grit - The coarseness or fineness of the cutting edges on tumbling media, affecting the speed and finish quality of the tumbling process.
- Linear graining - A true finished product that creates a consistent uniform finish, distinct from linear deburring which only removes slag.
- Belt sander - The machine used in linear deburring that grinds away the top surface of parts to remove burrs.
- Slag - The outer crust or material left behind from the laser cutting process that needs to be removed.
- Undercut - A condition in laser cutting where material is cut in a way that creates burrs on the back side of the cut.
