## Springs Overview

### Elastic Materials
- Lead - Not springy, deforms permanently
- Aluminum - Slightly better than lead but still deforms easily
- Laminate - Better but brittle
- Wood - Good when straight-grained, used in bed slats and longbows
- Rubber - Very springy, good for prototypes but perishes over time
- Spring steel - Alloy with carbon and manganese, returns to original position

### Spring Types
- Strip springs - Simple strips of material, used in locks and car leaf springs
- Coil springs (expansion springs) - Most common type, easy to make
- Compression springs - Squash instead of stretch, prone to buckling when long
- Torsion springs - Clock springs, used in safety pins and clothes pegs
- Constant force springs - Maintain same force regardless of position
- Variable rate springs - Conical shape, different parts compress at different rates
- Volute springs - Avoid buckling, used in secateurs
- Belleville washers - Small compression springs, used as torque limiters

### Spring Properties
- Hooke's Law - Elongation is proportional to load
- Natural frequency - Springs have resonant frequency that varies with weight
- Spring rate - Force needed per millimeter of extension
- Longer springs have lower spring rate than shorter springs
- Fatter diameter springs stretch more easily than tight ones
- Baggy springs can stretch to twice initial length, tight ones only 1.5 times

### Spring Making and Selection
- Made from spring steel wire on lathe
- Ends formed into loops using vise and pliers
- Cut with grinding disc, not hacksaw (hard steel)
- Spring catalogs available but confusing
- Trial and error often better than catalogs
- Spring boxes with assorted springs good value
- Ends must be free to move, not clamped

### Applications
- Spring balances for measuring weight
- Clock mechanisms and pocket watches
- Car suspension systems
- Record players and wind-up mechanisms

- Shock absorbers for controlled stopping
- Counterweights as alternative to springs

### Terms

## Complete Answer Key

1. **What material is described as "not really good for permanent things" because it perishes?**
   - Answer: C) Natural rubber
   - *Explanation: Natural rubber breaks down over time due to exposure to oxygen, UV light, and temperature changes, making it unsuitable for permanent applications.*

2. **According to Hooke's Law, what is the relationship between load and elongation in springs?**
   - Answer: B) Elongation is proportional to load 
   - *Explanation: Hooke's Law states that the amount a spring stretches is directly proportional to the force applied - double the force, double the stretch.*

3. **What type of spring is most commonly used in the video maker's machines?**
   - Answer: A) Expansion springs (coil springs)
   - *Explanation: Coil springs are the most common type because they're easy to make, reliable, and work well for most applications.*

4. **Why do longer springs have a lower spring rate than shorter springs?**
   - Answer: D) The force needed per millimeter is greater for short lengths
   - *Explanation: Longer springs have more material to distribute the force across, so each millimeter stretches more easily than in shorter springs.*

5. **What is the main problem with compression springs when they get long and thin?**
   - Answer: C) They want to buckle instead of compressing squarely
   - *Explanation: Long, thin compression springs bend sideways (buckle) instead of compressing straight down, making them ineffective.*

6. **What is a volute spring designed to avoid?**
   - Answer: A) Buckling
   - *Explanation: Volute springs have a conical shape that prevents buckling by providing better support as they compress.*

7. **What is the main advantage of counterweights over springs?**
   - Answer: B) They are more reliable and have nothing to go wrong
   - *Explanation: Counterweights are simple weights that don't wear out, break, or lose their properties over time like springs can.*

8. **What happens to the natural frequency of a spring when weight is added?**
   - Answer: C) It decreases
   - *Explanation: Adding weight makes the spring-mass system oscillate more slowly, lowering its natural frequency.*

9. **What is the purpose of a fusee in clock mechanisms?**
   - Answer: D) To provide almost perfectly constant force as the spring unwinds
   - *Explanation: A fusee is a spiral mechanism that compensates for the decreasing force as a clock spring unwinds, keeping the clock running at constant speed.*

10. **What type of spring maintains the same force regardless of how far it's stretched?**
    - Answer: A) Constant force spring
    - *Explanation: Constant force springs are specially designed to provide the same pulling force throughout their range of motion.*

11. **What is a negator spring?**
    - Answer: C) A special spring in tape measures that stays straight
    - *Explanation: Negator springs are coiled in a way that allows them to stay straight when extended, perfect for tape measure applications.*

12. **What are Belleville washers used for in the video?**
    - Answer: B) As torque limiters
    - *Explanation: Belleville washers act as small compression springs that compress when too much torque is applied, protecting mechanisms from damage.*

13. **What is the main reason the video maker doesn't often use torsion springs?**
    - Answer: D) They are harder to adjust
    - *Explanation: Torsion springs work by twisting, which makes them more difficult to fine-tune compared to simple coil springs.*

14. **What happens when you try to cut spring steel with a hacksaw?**
    - Answer: A) It's hard steel so you can't cut it
    - *Explanation: Spring steel is hardened steel that's too tough for a hacksaw - you need a grinding disc or other specialized cutting tool.*

15. **What happens to the spring rate when you use a shorter length of the same spring?**
    - Answer: B) It increases
    - *Explanation: Shorter springs are stiffer because there's less material to stretch, so more force is needed per millimeter of extension.*

16. **What is the purpose of shock absorbers when used with springs?**
    - Answer: C) To provide a much better ride by controlling bouncing
    - *Explanation: Shock absorbers dampen the bouncing motion of springs, converting the energy into heat and providing smoother movement.*

17. **What is the main reason the video maker doesn't often use stainless steel springs?**
    - Answer: D) There's a compromise in spring characteristics to make them stainless
    - *Explanation: Making steel stainless requires adding elements that can reduce the steel's spring properties, making it less ideal for spring applications.*

18. **What is the main difference between a clock spring and a constant force spring?**
    - Answer: A) In clock springs, every part changes radius; in constant force springs, only a small section changes
    - *Explanation: Clock springs unwind from the outside in, changing the radius of every coil, while constant force springs only unwind from a small section.*

19. **What is the main advantage of using rubber stops instead of shock absorbers?**
    - Answer: B) They are much simpler and cheaper
    - *Explanation: Rubber stops are simple pieces of rubber that absorb impact without complex mechanisms, making them much easier and cheaper to use.*

20. **What happens to the elongation when you double the load on a spring?**
    - Answer: C) It doubles
    - *Explanation: According to Hooke's Law, if you double the force (load), the spring will stretch twice as much.*

21. **What is the main reason for using torque limiters in public mechanisms?**
    - Answer: D) To prevent people from getting their fingers stuck or hurt
    - *Explanation: Torque limiters prevent mechanisms from applying too much force, protecting users from injury in public devices.*

22. **What is the main problem with using natural rubber for permanent applications?**
    - Answer: A) It perishes over time
    - *Explanation: Natural rubber deteriorates due to environmental factors like oxygen, sunlight, and temperature, making it unsuitable for long-term use.*

23. **What is the main reason springs are used in spring balances?**
    - Answer: B) Because elongation is proportional to load
    - *Explanation: Since spring stretch is proportional to weight, you can measure weight by measuring how much the spring stretches.*

24. **What happens to the force in a spring when you stretch it to twice its initial length?**
    - Answer: C) It doubles
    - *Explanation: According to Hooke's Law, if you stretch a spring twice as far, it will pull back with twice the force.*

25. **What is the main advantage of using gas springs over physical springs?**
    - Answer: D) They are much more compact for the same force
    - *Explanation: Gas springs use compressed gas to provide force, allowing them to be much smaller than metal springs that provide the same amount of force.*
