### Machiavelli's Revolutionary Approach
- Transformation of moral vocabulary about virtue and vice
- Replacement of Platonic/Christian virtue with worldly power
- Virtù related to manliness, force, and power
- Association of virtue with worldly glory and ambition
- Teaches the prince "how not to be good"

### The Problem of "Dirty Hands"
- Politicians must be prepared to get hands dirty
- Conflict between political necessities and moral purity
- "Cruelty well used" as a virtue in statecraft
- Statecraft requires accepting harsh necessities
- Incompatibility between Christian innocence and political effectiveness

### Religion and Politics
- Religion evaluated by consequences for society, not truth
- Christianity makes the world "weak" or "effeminate"
- Use religion to encourage self-reliance ("one's own arms")
- Retelling of David and Goliath story with added knife
- Religion necessary to control and direct social character

### Machiavelli's View of Government
- Societies divided between principalities and republics
- Two "humors" in society: desire not to be oppressed vs. desire to rule
- The people more reliable than the nobles ("grandi")
- Prince should build power base on the people rather than nobles
- Nobles are more dangerous and fickle than common people

### What Machiavelli Achieved
- Unprecedented break with classical and biblical authority
- Liberation of politics from ecclesiastical control
- Introduction of a new kind of populism
- Creation of a new kind of republic: armed and expansive
- Establishment of amoral realism in politics
- New openness about political realities previously taught covertly

### Terms
- Virtù - Machiavelli's concept of virtue related to manliness, force, and power rather than moral goodness
- Grandi - The rich and powerful nobles who desire to rule and dominate others
- Popolo - The common people who desire neither to rule nor be ruled, but simply not to be oppressed
- Umori (Humors) - Psychological dispositions that characterize different social classes
- Dirty Hands - The problem of reconciling moral principles with political necessities
- One's Own Arms - Relying on one's own military power rather than mercenaries or allies; metaphorically, self-reliance
- Cruelty Well Used - Strategic use of violence that ultimately creates stability and security
- Effectual Truth - Focus on how things actually work rather than how they should ideally be
