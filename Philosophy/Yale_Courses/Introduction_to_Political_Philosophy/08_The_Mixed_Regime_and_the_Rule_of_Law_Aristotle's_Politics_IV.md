### Regime - Central Concept of Aristotle's Politics
- Books III through VI develop the idea of regime (politeia)
- Centerpiece of Aristotle's political thought
- Regime refers to both formal rights/duties and way of life/culture of a people
- Gives a city its identity and enduring existence over time

### What Constitutes a Regime
#### Matter (Substance) of a Regime
- Citizen body and its character
- Not defined by:
  - Common territory or geography
  - Defensive alliance against invasion
  - Commercial relations
- Citizens are held together by bonds of common affection (philia)
- Civic friendship involves competitive rivalry for positions of honor
- Citizens are like siblings competing for recognition from the city

#### Form (Structure) of a Regime
- Arrangement of offices and distribution of power
- Every regime answers the question: who governs?
- Defined by its ruling body
- Six-fold classification of regimes:
  - Well-ordered: monarchy (one), aristocracy (few), polity (many)
  - Corrupt: tyranny (one), oligarchy (few), democracy (many)

### Democratic Regime
- Aristotle defends democracy as potentially containing greater collective wisdom
- Compares democratic deliberation to a potluck dinner - better variety than a single chef
- The many together become "like a single human being" with many senses
- The many are "more incorruptible" than the few

### Law, Conflict and the Mixed Regime
- Every regime involves class struggle between rich and poor
- Competition for positions of honor, status, and rule
- Law as remedy to offset factional conflict
- "Law is intellect without appetite"
- Law ensures equal treatment and prevents arbitrary rule
- Tension between rule of law and rule by the best individual
- Law is general but limited in addressing particular situations

### Natural Right and Justice
- Natural right is mutable/changeable according to circumstances
- Justice revealed in concrete decisions, not universal maxims
- Statesman must respond to new situations with appropriate action
- What is naturally right in peace differs from war, normal from emergency
- Aristotelian statesman aims to restore constitutional government quickly

### Terms
- Politeia - Regime or constitution; gives identity to a city
- Philia - Affection or friendship that holds citizens together
- Thumos - Spiritedness; source of both human assertiveness and resistance to domination
- Pambasileia - Universal king or absolute monarch
- Natural Right - Standards of justice that are natural but mutable depending on circumstances
- Mixed Regime - Combination of democratic and oligarchic elements
- Rule of Law - Impartial standard that prevents arbitrary rule
