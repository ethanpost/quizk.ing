### Euclid of Alexandria
- Greek mathematician and philosopher who lived around 300 BCE
- Considered the father of geometry
- Quote: "The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God"
- Appearance unknown (Raphael's painting is an artist's impression)

### Etymology of Geometry
- Greek roots: "Geo" (Earth) + "Metry" (measurement)
- Essentially means "Earth measurement"

### Euclid's Elements
- 13-volume textbook written around 300 BCE
- Most famous textbook of all time
- Second most printed book in Western world after the Bible
- Originally written in Greek, later translated to Arabic, Latin, and eventually English
- First English translation published in 1570

### Content of Euclid's Elements
- Covered geometry, number theory, and solid geometry
- Focused on planar geometry in the first six books
- Rigorous, logical progression through mathematical concepts

### Euclid's Methodology
- Started with basic assumptions (axioms/postulates)
- Used deductive reasoning to prove other statements (propositions/theorems)
- Created a scaffold of mathematical knowledge
- Proved statements beyond doubt rather than assuming their truth

### Historical Significance
- Considered essential education for over 2,000 years
- Studied by influential figures including Abraham Lincoln
- Lincoln used it to understand the concept of "demonstration" (proof beyond doubt)
- Lincoln studied until he could recite any proposition from the six books "at sight"

### Purpose of Studying Geometry
- Develops rigorous, logical thinking
- Teaches how to prove statements beyond doubt
- Represents "real mathematics" beyond arithmetic computation
- Demonstrates making assumptions and deducing conclusions

### Terms
- Geometry - From Greek words meaning "Earth measurement"; the branch of mathematics dealing with shapes, sizes, and properties of space
- Euclid - Greek mathematician considered the father of geometry who lived around 300 BCE
- Euclid's Elements - 13-volume textbook written by Euclid that systematically presented geometry and other mathematical concepts
- Axioms/Postulates - Basic assumptions that are accepted without proof as the foundation for geometric reasoning
- Propositions/Theorems - Statements that are proven through logical deduction from axioms and previously proven theorems
- Euclidean Geometry - The study of geometry based on Euclid's axioms and methods
- Demonstration - As Lincoln discovered, proof beyond the possibility of doubt through rigorous reasoning
