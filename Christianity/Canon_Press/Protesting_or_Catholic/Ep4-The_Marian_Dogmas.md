## The Marian Dogmas Overview

### Introduction
- Major difference between Protestants and Catholics regarding Mary
- Many Catholics participate in Marian devotion without understanding the theology
- Marian piety is central to Roman Catholicism
- The speaker believes Marian practices are a reason to be Protestant

### Marian Practices and Devotion
- The rosary is primarily directed towards Mary
- Medallions and scapulars are worn, believed to confer special grace
- People consecrate themselves to Mary's service
- Marian processions are common
- Marian apparitions (geographically specific appearances)
- Examples: Our Lady of Guadalupe, Our Lady of Fatima
- Social media quotes about Mary as mediator to Jesus
- Mary looms very large in Roman Catholicism

### The Four Marian Dogmas
- Theotocos (Mother of God/Godbearer)
  - Affirmed at Council of Ephesus in 431 against Nestorians
  - Protestants historically affirm this
  - More a statement about Christ than Mary
  - Affirms Jesus was fully God even in Mary's womb
- Perpetual Virginity
  - Mary never consummated marriage to Joseph
  - Very old doctrine, some reformers believed it
  - Contradicts Matthew 1:25
  - Historically included postpartum virginity (physically intact during/after birth)
  - Originated from second century apocryphal text: Protoevangelium of James
- Immaculate Conception
  - Not about Jesus's conception
  - Doctrine that Mary was conceived without original sin
  - Associated with completely sinless life
  - Jesus and Mary as only two sinless humans
  - Fully formulated in Middle Ages
  - Duns Scotus (Franciscan) helped make it popular in 13th century
  - Many Protestants see this as blasphemous
- Assumption of Mary
  - Declared dogma by Pope in 1950
  - Belief that Mary was taken up body and soul into heaven
  - Not widely believed for centuries
  - First appears in heretical gnostic text: Book of Mary's Repose
  - Grew popular by sixth century in the East

### Other Marian Doctrines (Not Dogmas)
- Queen of Heaven
- Mother of the Church
- Mediatrix
- Co-Redemptrix (desired by many, not yet dogmatized)
- Various approved Marian apparitions

### Justification for Marian Dogmas
- Required beliefs should be grounded in divine revelation
- Both Protestants and Catholics agree age of public revelation ended with last apostle
- Mandatory doctrines should be explicit or implicitly contained in apostolic teaching
- Protestants believe Scripture is only reliably preserved revelation
- Roman church includes unwritten traditions as part of Word of God
- Three approaches Catholics use:
  - Typological extrapolation from Scripture (Ark of Covenant, woman in Revelation)
  - Explicit in unwritten oral traditions from apostles
  - Implicit in oral tradition
- Problems with these approaches:
  - Scripture does not necessitate these teachings
  - Typology is ambiguous
  - Early church evidence goes against sinlessness and assumption
  - Early tradition contradicts modern Roman teaching

### Scriptural Evidence
- Mary appears rarely in New Testament
- Gospels give her little airtime
- Straightforward reading indicates Mary was a sinner
- Romans 3:23 - "all have sinned and fall short"
- Catholics claim Mary was redeemed by being preserved from sin, but passage says "all have sinned"
- Paul never mentions Mary by name
- Mary hardly mentioned in early tradition
- Almost absent in first and second century writings of apostolic fathers

### Early Church Evidence
- Second century writers echo Paul
- Justin Martyr: Jesus was "the only blameless and righteous man"
- Clement of Alexandria: "this word of whom we speak alone is sinless"
- Protoevangelium of James only advocates postpartum virginity, nothing about sinlessness or assumption
- Odes of Solomon reference painless birth, but that doesn't establish sinlessness
- Centuries of silence is evidence
- Many church fathers contradict modern Roman teaching
- St. Basil the Great: Christ had to redeem Mary from sin of doubt
- Tertullian: In Matthew 12, Mary is figure for unbelieving synagogue
- Origen: Mary was scandalized and sinned, had to be redeemed like everyone else
- St. John Chrysostom, Cyril of Alexandria, and others teach Mary was sinful
- St. Epiphanius: No one knows what happened to Mary (contradicts assumption)
- Perpetual virginity became default in third/fourth centuries due to apocryphal texts and rise of asceticism
- Mary's sinlessness and assumption show signs of being later inventions
- Many popes and Catholic theologians rejected immaculate conception through Middle Ages and Reformation
- Some Catholics in 1900s didn't support assumption becoming dogma

### Devotional Practices and Quotes
- Pope Pius XII (1953): "Nothing more sweet... than to worship, venerate, invoke, and praise... the mother of God"
- Uses same Latin word as idolatry prohibitions in Vulgate
- St. Alphonsus Liguori's "The Glories of Mary"
- St. Bernardine: Mary raised to "sort of equality with divine persons by almost infinity of graces"
- St. Bernard: God created whole world for Mary
- St. Bonaventure: World's existence depends on Mary's will
- St. Bernardine: God preserved man after Adam's sin on account of love for Mary
- These quotes should give pause
- Question of whether Marian devotions violate command against graven images

### Conclusion
- Badly catechized lay people exist in every religion
- Some lay Catholics mistakenly think Mary is part of Trinity
- This may be due to practices that render divine honors to a human being
- Church fathers, Protestants, and Scripture hold Mary to have been a sinner
- Mary is most blessed among women, beloved mother of Lord, but a sinner nonetheless
- Marian dogmas and devotions are grievous offenses against Mary and her son

### Terms
- Theotocos - Greek term meaning "Godbearer," normally translated as "Mother of God," affirmed at Council of Ephesus in 431 to affirm that Jesus was fully God even in Mary's womb
- Perpetual Virginity - Doctrine that Mary never consummated her marriage to Joseph and remained a physically intact virgin even during and after giving birth to Jesus
- Immaculate Conception - Doctrine that Mary was herself miraculously conceived without original sin and led a completely sinless life, making her and Jesus the only two sinless humans
- Assumption of Mary - Dogma declared in 1950 that Mary was taken up body and soul into heaven at the end of her life
- Marian Apparitions - Beliefs that Mary has appeared to people and given special revelations, often geographically specific (e.g., Our Lady of Guadalupe, Our Lady of Fatima)
- Rosary - Prayer beads primarily directed towards Mary, prayed by faithful Catholics daily
- Scapular - A piece of cloth worn by Catholics, often with images of Mary, believed to confer special grace
- Mediatrix - Title for Mary meaning she is a mediator between God and humanity
- Co-Redemptrix - Proposed title for Mary meaning she is co-redeemer with Christ, not yet dogmatized but desired by many Catholics
- Protoevangelium of James - Second century anonymous apocryphal text that originated the idea of Mary's postpartum virginity
- Book of Mary's Repose - Heretical gnostic text where the assumption of Mary first appears
- Typological Extrapolation - Method of interpreting Scripture where Old Testament types (like Ark of Covenant) are seen as pointing to Mary
- Council of Ephesus - Church council in 431 that affirmed Mary as Theotocos against the Nestorians
- Duns Scotus - Franciscan theologian of the 13th century who helped make the Immaculate Conception popular
