Generate 100 multiple choice quiz questions below the "Quiz:" line that you would expect a 9th grader to know about the following subjects:

Social Studies
History
Science
English
Literature

Make sure you adhere to the following format. Do not number the questions. You can create True/False questions or multiple choice questions. A True/False question should have two possible answers, True or False. Create as many questions as needed to cover all of the content. Better to error on the side of too many questions than not enough. Make sure the answers are not always in the same position in the options list. Make sure blank lines are always between every line. Each questions should end with a "///" on a new line. See the example below:
