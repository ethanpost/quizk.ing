### Historical Context
- Puente Hills Landfill in Los Angeles operated from 1957 to 2013
- Accepted up to 4 million tons of trash annually at its peak
- Represents evolution of landfill engineering over 56 years
- Federal regulations in 1976 transformed solid waste management

### Purpose and Challenges of Landfills
- Facilitate waste disposal without environmental or health consequences
- Address unavoidable waste generation in human society
- Evolution from simple holes in the ground to highly engineered systems
- Balance volume maximization with cost and environmental impact minimization

### Landfill Siting Considerations
- Geometry problem: maximizing waste volume while minimizing costs
- Underground vs. above-ground ("air space") construction
- Stability and settlement concerns with increasing height
- Location restrictions: airports, residential areas, floodplains, wildlife habitats
- Infrastructure requirements: scale house, equipment storage, drop-off areas
- Traffic accommodation for constant truck movement
- Multidisciplinary requirements: geology, geography, politics, archaeology, biology, engineering

### Contamination Prevention
- Water infiltration causes "leachate" (garbage juice) production
- Leachate can contaminate groundwater and migrate beyond landfill boundaries
- Bottom liner systems using plastic membranes and/or compacted clay
- Leachate collection systems with perforated pipes and drainage layers
- Leachate management through off-site treatment or on-site processing

### Operational Management
- Waste compaction to maximize space utilization
- Daily cover application at end of each day
- Alternative cover materials: tarps, foundry sand, foam, paper, shredded tires
- Continuous environmental monitoring: groundwater, surface water, air quality
- Cell-based construction for phased development

### Landfill Closure
- Final cover system with multiple protective layers
- Vegetation establishment to prevent erosion
- Gas collection systems for methane and hydrogen sulfide
- Careful gas management to prevent fires and explosions
- Beneficial use of landfill gas for heat or electricity generation
- Post-closure monitoring for at least 30 years
- Potential for conversion to parks or recreational spaces

### Environmental and Economic Perspectives
- Properly designed landfills prevent waste from contaminating soil, air, and water
- Geographic limitations in densely populated areas
- Relatively low environmental impact where feasible
- Cost-effective waste management method
- Lifelong maintenance included in user fees

### Terms
- Municipal Solid Waste - Waste collected at the city level, primarily from households and businesses
- Leachate - Liquid that forms when water filters through waste in a landfill, containing dissolved contaminants
- Bottom Liner - Impermeable layer at the base of a landfill that prevents leachate from contaminating groundwater
- Daily Cover - Layer of soil or alternative materials placed over exposed waste at the end of each working day
- Interim Cover - Temporary covering placed over filled cells within a landfill before final closure
- Final Cover - Multilayered system that permanently seals a closed landfill
- Airspace - Volume above ground used for waste disposal in a landfill
- Landfill Cell - Individual section of a landfill developed in phases
- Landfill Gas - Mixture of gases (primarily methane and carbon dioxide) produced by decomposing waste
- Post-closure Care - Monitoring and maintenance of a closed landfill for at least 30 years
