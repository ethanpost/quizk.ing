### The Nature of Political Philosophy
- Political philosophy as a branch of political science
- Also the oldest and most fundamental part of political science
- Lays bare the fundamental problems, concepts, and categories
- Foundation of the entire discipline
- Begins with the study of great books and thinkers
- Features thinkers from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Tocqueville, and Nietzsche

### Value and Challenges of Studying Political Philosophy
- Risks of studying only certain thinkers (potential bias in selection)
- Dangers of antiquarianism and pedantry
- Questions about relevance to modern issues
- Why political science continues to study ancient texts while other disciplines don't
- Great works provide fundamental questions with clarity and insight
- Their doctrines remain constitutive of basic outlooks and attitudes
- Political philosophy is not just an appendage but constitutive of the deepest problems

### The Approach to Political Philosophy
- No permanent answers in political philosophy
- Profound disagreement among great thinkers over fundamental questions
- No final authorities in philosophy
- Readers must use their own reason and judgment
- Political philosophy as a practical discipline focused on advice-giving
- Great thinkers were not detached intellectuals but engaged in politics of their time

### Fundamental Questions of Political Philosophy
- What is justice?
- What are the goals of a decent society?
- How should a citizen be educated?
- Why should I obey the law, and what are the limits to my obligation?
- What constitutes the ground of human dignity?
- Questions about God's existence and implications

### The Concept of Regime
- The oldest and most fundamental political concept
- Regimes as forms of government
- Defined by how people are governed and how offices are distributed
- Political world structured into a few basic regime types
- Regimes are particular and stand in opposition to other regime types
- Politics involves conflict, tension, and partisanship
- Regimes instill loyalties and passions

### Characteristics of Regimes
- More than formal structures and institutions
- Encompasses entire way of life, moral and religious practices
- Constitutes an ethos or distinctive character
- Shapes common character types with distinctive traits
- Represents what a society finds praiseworthy
- Cannot understand a regime without understanding what it stands for

### Founding of Regimes
- Question of how regimes are founded and sustained
- Some thinkers (Tocqueville) see regimes as embedded in deep structures of history
- Others (Plato, Machiavelli, Rousseau) believe regimes can be deliberately founded
- Hamilton's question: Can societies establish governments through "reflection and choice"?

### Statesmanship
- Who is a statesman and what makes a good statesman?
- Political science as a science of statecraft
- Different views on qualities necessary for statesmanship:
  - Plato: Statesman as philosopher versed in poetry, mathematics, metaphysics
  - Aristotle: Statesmanship as practical skill requiring judgment and experience
  - Machiavelli: Need for cruelty and immorality
  - Rousseau: Ability to transform human nature
  - Hobbes: Sovereign as bureaucrat

### The Best Regime
- Political philosophy guided by question of the best regime
- Ancient view: Aristocratic republic with rule by the few best
- Modern view: Democratic republic with offices open to all
- Tension between small closed society focused on self-perfection vs. cosmopolitan order
- Best regime favors certain human types and character traits
- Paradox: Best regime superior to all actual regimes but has no concrete existence

### Good Human Being vs. Good Citizen
- Aristotle's distinction between good human being and good citizen
- Good citizen is regime-specific (patriotism)
- Good human being is good everywhere
- Good human being loves what is good because it is good
- Philosopher may only be at home in the best regime
- Tension between best regime and actual regimes creates space for political philosophy
- Political philosophy exists in "zone of indeterminacy" between "is" and "ought"

### Terms
- Political Philosophy - The oldest and most fundamental part of political science that seeks to lay bare the fundamental problems, concepts, and categories of politics.
- Regime - A form of government defined by how people are governed and how offices are distributed; encompasses a society's entire way of life, moral practices, and values.
- Statesman - A leader charged with steering the ship of state; qualities vary across different political thinkers.
- Best Regime - The ideal form of government that serves as a standard against which to judge actual regimes; has never actually existed.
- Good Citizen - One who upholds the laws of their country because they are their own; regime-specific and defined by patriotism.
- Good Human Being - One who loves what is good simply because it is good, not because it is their own; good everywhere regardless of regime.
- Ethos - The distinctive character that a regime nurtures, shaping common character types with distinctive traits.
- Eros - The Greek word for love, used to describe the desire for knowledge of the best regime.
- Politea - The Greek word meaning constitution or regime; the original title of Plato's Republic.
