## Outline

### Machine Categories and Axes
- Machines operate in XYZ coordinate system similar to CAD
- Two-axis machines: move only in planar (X and Y) directions
- Two-axis machines can only do through cuts, not partial depths
- Three-axis machines: add Z-axis movement (up and down)
- Three-axis machines can perform partial depth cuts
- Three-plus axis machines: add rotational axes (A and B axes)
- Five-axis machines allow for more complex designs and orientations

### Two-Axis Machines
- Fiber laser: 12K fiber laser for cutting conductive materials (metals)
- CO2 laser: for cutting non-conductive materials (plastics, some woods)
- Water jet: uses high-pressure water mixed with garnet for cutting
- Water jet: excellent for composite materials (G10, carbon fiber, finale)
- Water jet: useful for materials that are toxic when cut with lasers
- Tube laser: operates in rotation and linear fashion (still two-axis)
- All two-axis machines have Z adjustment for different material thicknesses
- Z adjustment is for material setup, not for partial depth cutting

### Three-Axis Machines
- CNC routers are three-axis machines
- Spindle assembly holds CNC router endmills
- Head unit moves up and down on linear rails (Z-axis)
- Gantry machine setup: machine moves around the material
- Gantry setup allows cutting of larger sheet goods (like 4x8 plywood)
- Vacuum table used for work holding (no clamping needed)
- Can cut partial depths unlike two-axis machines

### Three-Plus Axis Machines
- Five-axis CNC milling machines at SendCutSend
- Can rotate about X and Y axes (A and B axes)
- Allows machining multiple faces without repositioning
- Can create complex orientations and features
- Has hundreds of different tools for various features
- Multiple pallets allow unattended operation
- Machine holds the part (unlike gantry routers)

### Design Implications
- Partial depth features require three-axis or higher machines
- Two-axis machines cannot do partial depths
- Two-axis machines might cut blanks that need secondary finishing
- Router gantry setup allows larger parts (machine moves around material)
- CNC mills limited by work envelope size (part is held stationary)
- Work envelope limitations directly affect design capabilities
- Material and machine selection affects design complexity
- Website guidelines provide most up-to-date cutting process information

9. **A** - True. Even though tubes are three-dimensional, the tube laser only moves in rotation and linear fashion, making it a two-axis machine.

10. **C** - Three-axis machines gain the Z-axis, which allows vertical movement up and down, enabling partial depth cuts.

11. **B** - Three-axis machines can perform partial depth cuts because they have Z-axis capability, unlike two-axis machines.

12. **C** - The spindle assembly is the component that holds the endmill in a CNC router, as shown and described in the video.

13. **B** - Gantry machines move around the material, which is the key difference from machines that hold the part stationary.

14. **D** - The gantry setup allows cutting of larger sheet goods because the machine moves around the material rather than being limited by a fixed work envelope.

15. **B** - CNC routers use vacuum tables for work holding, which was specifically demonstrated in the video.

16. **B** - Vacuum tables allow quick material changes by simply turning the vacuum on and off, eliminating the need to clamp each piece.

17. **C** - The video explicitly states that SendCutSend's CNC milling machines are five-axis machines.

22. **B** - Partial depth features require three-axis or higher machines because two-axis machines can only do through cuts.

23. **B** - If you use a two-axis machine for partial depths, you might cut a blank that needs secondary finishing on another machine.

24. **B** - Routers move around the material (gantry setup) while mills hold the part stationary, which affects part size capabilities.

25. **B** - CNC mills are limited by their work envelope size because the part is held stationary, unlike gantry routers.

26. **C** - The limitations of work envelope and machine capabilities directly affect design capabilities, as emphasized in the video.

27. **B** - The video recommends checking the SendCutSend website guidelines for each cutting process for the most up-to-date information.

28. **B** - Spindle assembly is defined as the component of a CNC router that holds the endmill and moves on linear rails.

29. **B** - Endmill is the cutting tool used in CNC routers and mills to remove material from the workpiece.

30. **B** - Partial depth is a cut that does not go completely through the material, requiring Z-axis movement capability.
