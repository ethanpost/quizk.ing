## Springs Overview

### Elastic Materials
- Lead - Not springy, deforms permanently
- Aluminum - Slightly better than lead but still deforms easily
- Laminate - Better but brittle
- Wood - Good when straight-grained, used in bed slats and longbows
- Rubber - Very springy, good for prototypes but perishes over time
- Spring steel - Alloy with carbon and manganese, returns to original position

### Spring Types
- Strip springs - Simple strips of material, used in locks and car leaf springs
- Coil springs (expansion springs) - Most common type, easy to make
- Compression springs - Squash instead of stretch, prone to buckling when long
- Torsion springs - Clock springs, used in safety pins and clothes pegs
- Constant force springs - Maintain same force regardless of position
- Variable rate springs - Conical shape, different parts compress at different rates
- Volute springs - Avoid buckling, used in secateurs
- Belleville washers - Small compression springs, used as torque limiters

### Spring Properties
- Hooke's Law - Elongation is proportional to load
- Natural frequency - Springs have resonant frequency that varies with weight
- Spring rate - Force needed per millimeter of extension
- Longer springs have lower spring rate than shorter springs
- Fatter diameter springs stretch more easily than tight ones
- Baggy springs can stretch to twice initial length, tight ones only 1.5 times

### Spring Making and Selection
- Made from spring steel wire on lathe
- Ends formed into loops using vise and pliers
- Cut with grinding disc, not hacksaw (hard steel)
- Spring catalogs available but confusing
- Trial and error often better than catalogs
- Spring boxes with assorted springs good value
- Ends must be free to move, not clamped

### Applications
- Spring balances for measuring weight
- Clock mechanisms and pocket watches
- Car suspension systems
- Record players and wind-up mechanisms
- Torque limiters for safety
- Shock absorbers for controlled stopping
- Counterweights as alternative to springs

### Terms

- Plastic deformation - Permanent deformation that doesn't return to original shape
- Spring steel - Alloy steel with carbon and manganese for spring properties
- Hooke's Law - Principle that spring elongation is proportional to applied load
- Natural frequency - Resonant frequency of spring-mass system
- Spring rate - Force required per unit of extension or compression
- Coil spring - Spring made by winding wire in helical pattern
- Compression spring - Spring that works by being compressed
- Torsion spring - Spring that works by twisting motion
- Constant force spring - Spring that maintains constant force over range of motion
- Variable rate spring - Spring with changing spring rate over range of motion
- Volute spring - Conical spring that avoids buckling
- Belleville washer - Dish-shaped washer that acts as small compression spring
- Torque limiter - Device that limits maximum torque transmission
- Shock absorber - Device that dampens motion and absorbs energy
- Counterweight - Weight used to balance another weight
- Fusee - Spiral mechanism in clocks to provide constant force
- Negator spring - Special spring in tape measures that stays straight
