### Introduction and History
- Chain mechanisms used extensively in clocks and arcade machines
- Bike chain is most familiar type - amazingly efficient (up to 99% efficient)
- Much better than belt or gear drive for energy transfer
- Both roller chain and ball race bearings invented for bicycles in late 19th century
- Leonardo drew bike chain but technology didn't exist to make it
- Earliest transmission chain was traditional chain made of raw iron by blacksmiths
- Still used in chain block tool for precise positioning with enormous power
- Industrial revolution saw various chain designs
- Bush chain made biggest difference - pins contact all way through bush
- Much larger contact area enabled greater loads and longer life
- Invented by Hans Reynolds in 1880, founded Reynolds Chain Company
- Immediately used on Starley's safety bicycle

### Chain Transmission Uses
- Connect motor to mechanism
- Useful to put motor out of the way
- Speed reduction - much more power available than needed
- Smaller chain allows more compact speed reduction
- Sprocket wheels can be basis of various mechanisms
- Great for linear motion (cars in wildlife machine)
- Amazingly forgiving - derailleur gears work by shoving chain off gear
- Sprocket wheels don't need to be precise
- Can cut with angled grinder or plasma cutter
- Chain doesn't have to be tight to work
- Very flexible and forgiving

### Chain Sizes and Specifications
- Confusing due to many different sizes
- Americans use imperial sizes, creating two whole ranges
- Two important dimensions: pitch (distance between pins) and width (between inner faces of inner links)
- Smallest generally available: 5mm pitch
- Very beautiful and strong (carries over 20kg load)
- Expensive due to manufacturing difficulty
- 6mm chain - most commonly used
- 05B - 8mm pitch
- 06B - 9.525mm (3/8 inch)
- Half inch (12mm) bike chain - much thinner than industrial version
- Motorbike chain - even wider
- Largest chain: 1 inch pitch stainless steel (very heavy)

### Unusual Chain Types
- Leaf chain - carries particularly large loads, used on forklift trucks
- Duplex chain - two runs of chain together
- Triplex chain - three runs for even bigger loads
- Fuse chain - very tiny chain in old pocket watches (1800s)
- Light duty chain for model making - made of wire bent like jewelry
- Plastic chains available
- Ball chain - can go round corners, any 3D path
- Sprockets cut from Delrin, drilled and turned on lathe

### Chain Selection Considerations
- Price makes surprisingly little difference between sizes
- More metal in bigger chains but fewer links to manufacture
- Load - for most projects, don't come near rated load
- Space constraints - 6mm chain best for tight spaces
- Sprockets are smaller, everything fits in tiny space

### Splitting and Joining Chain
- Bike chain bought for single loop around rear wheel and pedals
- Generally buy in 5-meter boxes
- Cut to length by punching out pin
- Use chain extractor for bike chain and larger sizes
- Doesn't work for small chains (6mm, 8mm) - resort to punching pins
- Process: get pin to plate level, use center punch, parallel punch
- Conventional joining: split pin (required for bikes to get through frame)
- Spring clips for smaller sizes - sometimes work, sometimes too powerful
- Custom method: leave pin attached to far plate, punch back in
- More secure than expected, very adaptable
- Half links available for more accurate length adjustment

### Tensioning Chain
- Decide distance between pulleys
- Chain runs loose or tight
- Always make one pulley adjustable
- Different mechanisms vary in preferred tightness
- Theoretically should run almost tight, often runs better looser
- Cut slots on milling machine for adjustment
- Alternative: oversized holes with large penny washer
- Longer runs: lever arm with idler sprocket and spring
- Same idea as bike derailleur spring arm
- Keeps tension as chain jumps between sprockets
- More adjustable tension

### Attaching to Chain
- Useful to attach things for linear motion
- Best way: buy proper attachment chain
- Expensive (£50-80 per meter), custom made
- Two ways to make own: connecting links or welding
- Connecting links: drill holes in steel plate, replace outer plate
- Welding: messy but strong enough
- Easier with bigger sizes - neater welds
- Drill plate with holes right spacing (diameter of pins)
- TIG weld for better results
- Alternative: remove pin, put bolt in instead
- Quick way to attach things to bigger chains

### Lubrication Issues
- Chain is messy - can't avoid getting covered in grease
- Chain must be oiled to work properly
- Bike chain has hard life - picks up dirt from road
- Slowly stretches over time
- Can cause chain to fall off sprockets
- Marathon chain - costs more but brilliant solution
- No more iron filings, no trouble for years
- Motorbike chain alternative - o-rings seal grease inside
- Very bulky but effective
- Alternative to chain: toothed belts

### Toothed Belts
- Vast range of pitches and widths available
- Clever design - strands of strong fiber or stainless steel
- Wrapped round and round alongside each other
- Can't cut belt - must buy fixed lengths
- Problems with belt wearing
- Something jams, motor keeps running, sprocket wears belt
- Creates bald patch
- Steel washers on sprocket sides as guides often come off
- Solution: dot punch around aluminum to spread it
- Recently using smallest tooth belt - synchromesh 2.5mm pitch
- Breaking strain 10 times less than 6mm chain
- Much neater and more compact
- Can't run slack - jumps over teeth
- Must run taut, can be incredibly tight
- Used for linear motion (plasma cutter bed)
- Don't need full continuous loop
- Can use any old length
- Space-saving joining method with copper ferrule
- Squash in vise for connection

### Torque Limitation
- Sometimes need slip to prevent jamming
- Torque limiters on each mechanism
- Sprocket gripped against fiber washers
- Adjust torque with big nut
- Very precise adjustment
- Can make own: shoulder on shaft, thread, bracket, washer
- Special parts: Belleville washers (dished spring washers)
- Nylock nut to prevent coming undone

### Round Polyurethane Belts
- Simpler alternative for slip without precise adjustment
- Reduce wiring, avoid limit switches
- Let motor carry on, pulley slips
- Timing-based rather than switch-based
- Increases wear on pulleys and belt
- Green belt - stiff, doesn't stretch much
- Orange belt - more elastic
- Join by heating to weld
- Make own sprockets from acetyl plastic/Delrin or brass
- Ground lathe tool, 45-degree angle
- Pulleys must be 10 times bigger diameter than belt
- 50mm pulley with 5mm belt
- 25mm pulley with 3mm belt
- 2mm belt needs 20mm minimum pulley
- Much better than steel cable (needs 40x diameter)

### Terms
- Chain Block - Tool with geared down mechanism to move strongest front chain gradually with enormous power
- Bush Chain - Chain where pins contact all way through bush, enabling much larger contact area for greater loads
- Pitch - Distance between pins in a chain
- Chain Width - Distance between inner faces of inner links of chain
- Chain Extractor - Tool for removing pins from bike chain and larger chains
- Split Pin - Conventional way to join chain ends, required for bikes
- Spring Clip - Alternative joining method for smaller chain sizes
- Half Link - Special link allowing more accurate chain length adjustment
- Idler Sprocket - Sprocket used for tensioning, often on spring-loaded arm
- Attachment Chain - Special chain designed for attaching objects, expensive but proper solution
- Marathon Chain - Special chain that costs more but eliminates lubrication problems
- Toothed Belt - Alternative to chain with embedded fiber or steel strands
- Synchromesh - Type of toothed belt with 2.5mm pitch
- Torque Limiter - Device allowing controlled slip to prevent jamming
- Belleville Washer - Dished spring washer used in torque limiters
- Round Polyurethane Belt - Flexible belt that can slip, used to avoid limit switches
- Copper Ferrule - Fitting for joining toothed belts by squashing in vise

# Complete Answer Key

## Multiple Choice Questions

1. **What is the efficiency of bike chain for transferring pedaling energy to the wheel?**
   - Answer: A) 99%
   - Example: When you pedal your bicycle, almost all your energy goes to turning the wheel - only 1% is lost to friction and heat. This is why bikes are so efficient for transportation compared to cars.

2. **What are the two important dimensions for chain specifications?**
   - Answer: B) Pitch and width
   - Example: Think of pitch like the spacing between fence posts - it's the distance between chain pins. Width is like the thickness of the fence rails - it's the space between the inner faces of the chain links.

3. **What type of chain is used on forklift trucks for carrying large loads?**
   - Answer: A) Leaf chain
   - Example: When you see a forklift lifting heavy pallets in a warehouse, it uses leaf chain because it's designed to carry particularly large loads safely without breaking.

4. **What is duplex chain?**
   - Answer: C) Two runs of chain together
   - Example: Imagine two bicycle chains running side by side, connected together. This creates duplex chain for extra strength, like having two ropes instead of one for lifting something heavy.

5. **What is a half link used for?**
   - Answer: B) Adjusting chain length more accurately
   - Example: If your bike chain is just a tiny bit too long or too short, a half link lets you make a small adjustment instead of having to remove a whole link, which might make it too tight.

6. **What is an idler sprocket used for?**
   - Answer: C) Tensioning chain
   - Example: On a bicycle derailleur, there's a small sprocket that keeps the chain tight as it moves between different gears. This prevents the chain from falling off or getting too loose.

7. **What is marathon chain?**
   - Answer: A) A chain that eliminates lubrication problems
   - Example: Regular bike chains need oiling and get dirty, but marathon chain is sealed so it doesn't need oil and stays clean - perfect for bikes that are ridden in all weather.

8. **What is the main problem with toothed belts?**
   - Answer: B) They can't be cut to length
   - Example: Unlike rope that you can cut to any length, toothed belts come in fixed sizes. If you need a specific length, you have to buy it that way or use special joining methods.

9. **What is a torque limiter used for?**
   - Answer: C) Preventing jamming by allowing controlled slip
   - Example: If something gets stuck in a machine, the torque limiter lets the motor keep running while the mechanism slips, preventing damage - like a safety valve that releases pressure.

10. **What is the main advantage of round polyurethane belts?**
    - Answer: A) They can slip to avoid limit switches
    - Example: Instead of having sensors to stop a machine when something goes wrong, these belts can slip when there's too much resistance, automatically protecting the system.

11. **What is the minimum pulley diameter for polyurethane belts?**
    - Answer: B) 10 times the belt diameter
    - Example: If you have a 5mm belt, you need at least a 50mm pulley. This prevents the belt from bending too sharply, which would cause it to wear out quickly.

## True or False Questions

12. **Chain doesn't have to be tight to work properly.**
    - Answer: A) True
    - Example: Unlike a guitar string that must be tight to make sound, bike chains can work even when they're a bit loose. In fact, many mechanisms work better with slightly loose chains.

13. **Bike chain is more efficient than belt or gear drive.**
    - Answer: B) True
    - Example: A bike chain transfers 99% of your pedaling energy to the wheel, while belt drives might only transfer 95% and gear drives even less due to friction.

14. **You can cut toothed belts to any length you need.**
    - Answer: A) False
    - Example: Toothed belts have embedded fibers or steel strands that would be damaged if cut. You must buy them in the exact length needed or use special joining methods.

15. **Marathon chain costs more but eliminates lubrication problems.**
    - Answer: B) True
    - Example: Marathon chain costs £50-80 per meter compared to regular chain, but you never have to oil it or clean it, saving time and mess.

16. **Steel cable requires pulleys 40 times the cable diameter.**
    - Answer: B) True
    - Example: If you have a 2mm steel cable, you need at least an 80mm pulley. This is much larger than polyurethane belts, which only need 10 times the diameter.

17. **You can make your own torque limiters.**
    - Answer: A) True
    - Example: You can build a simple torque limiter using a shoulder on a shaft, thread, bracket, washer, and special Belleville washers - no need to buy expensive commercial ones.

18. **Polyurethane belts are joined by heating to weld.**
    - Answer: B) True
    - Example: To connect two ends of a polyurethane belt, you heat them up until they melt slightly, then press them together to form a strong welded joint.

19. **Chain block tools use traditional raw iron chain.**
    - Answer: A) True
    - Example: Chain blocks (used for lifting heavy loads) still use the old-fashioned raw iron chain made by blacksmiths because it's incredibly strong for precise positioning.

20. **Ball chain can go around any 3D path.**
    - Answer: B) True
    - Example: Unlike regular chain that only works in straight lines or simple curves, ball chain can twist and turn in any direction - like a flexible snake that can follow any path.
