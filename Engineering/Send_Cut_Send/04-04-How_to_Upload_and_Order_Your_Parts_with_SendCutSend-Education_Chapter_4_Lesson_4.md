## Uploading and Ordering Parts Overview

### Introduction
- Lesson focuses on importing CAD files into manufacturers like SendCutSend
- Building on previous lessons about exporting CAD files
- Understanding the manufacturing workflow

### Manufacturer Services
- Manufacturers like SendCutSend provide access to advanced equipment
- Services make manufacturing fast and affordable
- Can produce parts from one to 10,000 units
- Must follow manufacturer's DFM (Design for Manufacturing) rules and tolerances
- Following rules allows creation of almost anything
- Example: entire car made from sheet metal by following rules

### File Format Requirements
- Right file format is critical for manufacturing
- Two different file types for different machines
- Must export files correctly based on intended machine

### Website Upload Process
- Easy drag and drop or file selection interface
- Can use as guest or create login
- Upload file to website
- Follow workflow to specify how part should be made

### File Upload and Preview
- Drag and drop or choose file option
- DXF files can be uploaded
- System shows flat rendering of part after upload
- Bend lines appear in preview
- Default bend lines are at 90°
- Confirm measurements match CAD defaults
- Verify everything looks correct before proceeding

### Material Selection
- Choose material for part manufacturing
- Parts with bends require bendable materials
- Aluminum 5052 is the only aluminum alloy that can be bent
- Select appropriate thickness (e.g., 0.063 inches)
- Pricing, quantity, and details appear after material selection

### Secondary Operations
- Additional operations to enhance parts
- Bending operation available
- Can specify bend angle (e.g., 90 degrees)
- 3D rendering shows part preview
- Verify bend direction is correct
- Non-mirrored parts require correct bend direction
- View cube available for part orientation
- Hardware insertion available
- Catalog automatically detects holes in design
- Options include nuts, standoffs, and other hardware
- Can select specific hardware (e.g., 8-32 nut for thread)
- System automatically aligns hardware to available holes
- Can flip hardware orientation (inside or outside)

### Finishing Options
- Deburring is defaulted
- Can select no finish for faster processing
- Anodizing available as finishing option
- Can choose anodizing color (e.g., red)
- 3D rendering updates to show finish
- Hardware installation done after anodizing process

### Cart and Ordering
- Can continue as guest or sign in for benefits
- Cart shows breakdown of all services
- Shows number of parts
- Increasing quantity provides discounts
- Price per part decreases with higher quantities
- Example: price drops to $7.56 per part at higher quantities

### CAD Plugin Integration
- Alternative method to add parts directly
- Plugins available for SolidWorks and Fusion 360
- Access plugin through add-ins menu
- Find plugin in Fusion app store
- Search for "SendCutSend" in app store
- Download and install plugin
- Plugin appears in utilities menu

### Plugin Workflow
- Select sheet metal bodies to export
- Start quoting process from plugin
- Drop-down menu for metals
- System automatically shows appropriate materials
- Example: only shows 5052 aluminum if part has bends
- System automatically detects thickness from CAD
- Can click "show all" to see all thickness options
- Changing thickness in plugin also changes bend allowance and bend deduction
- Warning: changing thickness without updating CAD may result in incorrect parts
- Select thickness that matches CAD design
- Click quote to see pricing
- See price discounts at different quantities
- Click "add to cart" to add to cart
- Secondary operations can be added once in cart
