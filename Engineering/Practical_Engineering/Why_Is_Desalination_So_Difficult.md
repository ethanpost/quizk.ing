## Overview of Desalination
- Removal of salt from seawater
- Technology that has "always seemed right on the horizon"
- Over 18,000 desalination plants exist globally
- These plants provide less than 1% of global water needs
- Consume 25% of all energy used by the water industry

## Seawater Composition
- Salinity measured in parts per thousand (per mille)
- Typical seawater has 35 grams of dissolved salt per liter (35 permille)
- Could dissolve about 10 times more salt before saturation
- WHO recommends drinking water have less than 1 part per thousand dissolved solids
- Fresh water typically has less than 0.5 parts per thousand
- Desalination must reject more than 98% of salt from seawater

## Desalination Methods

### Distillation
- Oldest and most straightforward method
- Basic process:
  - Heat seawater until it evaporates
  - Salt remains behind while water becomes vapor
  - Condense vapor back to liquid form
- High energy requirements
  - Example: Small setup used almost 1 kWh for 200mL
  - Scaled to household use would cost ~$800/day
- Efficiency challenges:
  - Heat loss
  - Scale buildup on equipment
  - Reduced heat transfer efficiency
- Modern improvements:
  - Co-location with power plants to use waste heat
  - Heat recovery from condensation
  - Multiple evaporation stages
  - Lowering pressure to encourage evaporation
  - Flash evaporation to minimize scale buildup

### Membrane Filtration (Reverse Osmosis)
- Uses pressure to force water through semipermeable membranes
- Requires high pressure (around 600 psi or 40x atmospheric pressure)
- Major components:
  - High-pressure pumps
  - Spiral-wrapped membranes in pressure housing
  - Two output streams: permeate (clean water) and brine (concentrated salt water)
- More energy efficient than distillation
- Still requires significant energy input
- Modern RO plants use 1-2 kWh per cubic meter of water
- Sample setup used around 100 kWh per cubic meter

## Additional Processes and Challenges

### Pretreatment
- Required to remove dirt, algae, organic matter before desalination
- Prevents damage to membranes/evaporators
- Requires energy and chemical inputs

### Post-treatment
- Adds minerals back to water for taste
- Disinfection for distribution safety

### Brine Management
- Concentrated salt solution (about 2x seawater concentration)
- Environmental impact concerns
- Disposal methods:
  - Diffusers to spread brine for faster dilution
  - Blending with other water streams
  - Underground injection (expensive)

## Economic and Practical Considerations
- "Nuclear power of water supply" - simple concept with complex implementation
- Coupling of water costs with electricity costs
- More viable in:
  - Places with severe water scarcity (Middle East)
  - Areas with variable climate (California, Texas, Florida)
  - Locations with brackish water sources instead of seawater
- Public-private partnerships can help manage risks
- Private sector takes on financing and operational risks
- Utilities gain stability through water purchase agreements

## Future Outlook
- Theoretical minimum energy requirements exist
- Technology improving gradually
- Becoming more economically viable
- Will likely play a larger role in future water supplies

## Terms

- Per mille: Unit meaning parts per thousand, used to measure salinity
- Distillation: A desalination method that uses heat to evaporate and separate water from salt
- Reverse Osmosis (RO): A desalination method that uses pressure to force water through membranes that block salt
- Permeate: The clean water that passes through a membrane in reverse osmosis
- Brine: The concentrated salt solution that remains after desalination
- Flash Evaporator: Equipment that uses pressure reduction to evaporate water at lower temperatures
