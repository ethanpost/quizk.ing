### Company Background
- Founded in 1941 by Travis Dickey, a World War I veteran
- Started as a barbecue stand in Dallas, Texas
- Children took over the brand and expanded it
- Peaked at around 570 units by 2017
- Currently under 385 units globally as of December 2024

### Major Problems Leading to Collapse

#### Overexpansion Without Infrastructure
- Grew to 570 units in about a decade
- Rapid growth without proper support systems
- Franchises reported minimal field training
- Poor marketing execution
- Profit margin erosion
- System stretched beyond capabilities

#### Misleading Startup Costs
- FDD listed startup costs around $323,000
- Actual buildout costs exceeded $900,000 for many franchises
- Similar issues to Quiznos with oversized spaces
- Franchises grossly overpaying in construction and rent
- Cost discrepancies between different markets not properly disclosed

#### Poor Franchisee Validation
- Validation calls revealed cautionary tales
- Confidentiality clauses restricted franchisee communication
- 2019 survey results: 58% not profitable, 69% declining revenue
- 39% considering closing stores
- 85% wished they never invested in Dickey's
- Confirmation bias led many to ignore warning signs

#### Adversarial Legal Tactics
- Corporate sued franchises instead of solving disputes collaboratively
- Sued franchisee lawyers
- Even sued the arbitrator
- Created aggressive, litigious brand image
- Chilled franchisee trust

#### Supply Chain Conflicts and Greed
- Dickey's controlled supply chain
- Marked up required goods without alternatives
- Operators saw shrinking margins
- Franchisees paid more through vendors than at Costco
- Focus on vendor rebates over franchisee profitability

#### Failure to Evolve
- Model never evolved with changing market
- POS system was 10 years old
- No third-party delivery integration
- Stores became outdated
- Failed to adapt to customer expectations
- Competitors embraced technology and innovation

#### Poor Franchisee Selection
- Predatory sales tactics alleged
- Targeted veterans, immigrants, and inexperienced operators
- Inadequate capital requirements
- Lack of business acumen screening
- Insufficient training and support

### Lessons for Investors
- Franchisee profitability should be the focus, not gross revenue
- Validation is crucial - speak to current and former franchisees
- Beware of confirmation bias during due diligence
- Look for franchisee-first culture
- The system, not just the brand, is what you're buying
