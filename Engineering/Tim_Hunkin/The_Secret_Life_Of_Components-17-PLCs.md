### Introduction and Background
- PLCs are programmable logic controllers used in industrial automation
- Tim Hunkin uses Mitsubishi PLCs in his arcade machines
- Over 50 PLCs running daily, some for 20+ years without problems
- Main advantages: robust, reliable, long-lasting, backward compatible
- Main disadvantage: expensive compared to microcontrollers like Arduino
- Built for industrial automation where quality matters more than price

### Early Experience and Learning
- First PLC experience in 1991 on theme park ride project
- 24 different scenes controlled by Mitsubishi PLCs
- Initial struggle with misprinted manual code
- Learned ladder programming through this project
- Early arcade machines used linear sequences of motor events

### Cam Timers to PLCs Transition
- Originally used cam timers (drum sequences) for motor control
- Cam timers: mechanical devices with adjustable cams controlling switches
- Transparent operation - could see exactly what was happening
- PLCs can do same job as cam timers
- PLC advantages: LED indicators for troubleshooting, easier fault finding
- Industrial automation designed around quick fault resolution

### Getting Started with PLCs
- Recommended: buy second-hand PLCs on eBay
- Automation engineers upgrade systems, old PLCs become available
- Second-hand PLCs are well-made and reliable
- Mitsubishi chosen due to initial project experience
- Software cost can be expensive (Â£1300+)
- Student versions and helplines available from suppliers
- Cheaper alternatives exist online

### Basic PLC Layout and Components
- Inputs at top, outputs at bottom
- LED indicators for inputs and outputs
- Power, run, and error lights
- 24V power supply with stabilized output
- Enough power for sensors and relays
- SS terminals for sink/source configuration
- USB or proprietary connector for programming
- Run/stop switch
- Potentiometer for adjustable timers
- Internal processor, relays, and power supply

### Stepladder Programming
- Called "stepladder" because it's graphical like a ladder
- Each rung has input on left, output on right
- Inputs/outputs can be physical or internal (relays, counters, timers)
- Logic gates can be added in middle of rungs
- Program runs through rungs continuously (hundreds of times per second)
- Simple example: timer delay between input and output
- Monitoring function allows watching program execution
- Instructionalist method: text-based programming alternative

### Choosing a PLC
- Intelligent relays: simplest option, programmable on device itself
- Basic PLC range: FX3S series recommended (uses USB)
- Older PLCs work well but need dedicated connectors
- Speed differences don't affect most applications
- Pay for number of outputs (2-14 in budget series)
- No extension blocks available on basic models
- Avoid FX1 series (dim LEDs)
- 24V DC or mains power options
- Relay or transistor outputs available

### Inputs and Outputs
- Outputs: completely isolated, can use any voltage
- Different COM terminals allow variety of voltages
- Inputs: more complicated, PLC is 24V device
- Problem with 12V sensors (need relay conversion)
- PNP vs NPN sensor compatibility issues
- Sink/source configuration affects sensor compatibility
- Converter modules available for mixed sensor types
- Keep power supplies isolated for easier fault finding

### Processing Speed
- Modern PLCs: 0.2 microseconds per simple instruction
- Speed test with shaft encoder (400 steps per revolution)
- High-speed counters and pulse catch functions
- Speed adequate for most arcade machine applications
- Motion control extension blocks available for complex applications

### Extension Blocks
- Extra output blocks: cheapest way to get more outputs
- 8 or 16 extra outputs available
- FX2 range has connector for extension blocks
- FX3S doesn't support extension blocks
- Applied instructions: software-based extensions
- Compare function commonly used
- Pulse catch: interrupts to catch brief sensor pulses
- Avoid complex extension blocks when possible

### Programming States
- States: parts of program active at any one time
- Essential for complex games with branching logic
- One state can trigger different states based on conditions
- Makes complex programs manageable (2000+ lines)
- Easier fault finding by identifying which state is stuck
- Example: Mobility Master Class game with 25 different states

### Adding Arduinos
- Arduino used for specialized functions (stepper motor control)
- PLC switches Arduino on/off, Arduino handles complex calculations
- Separates concerns for easier fault finding
- Could be done entirely in PLC but separation helps troubleshooting

### Adding Video
- Early video: CD player with PLC controlling play/next track
- Modern approach: BrightSign players with script programming
- Up to 8 PLC outputs converted to binary for 256 different tracks
- Very fast switching between video tracks
- Reliable but expensive solution

### Simplicity and Reliability
- PLCs simpler than ordinary computers
- No updates, startup/shutdown routines, or internet connection
- Basic simplicity is why they remain widely used
- Suitable for bespoke industrial automation projects
- Similar to arcade machines: prototypes needing tweaking

### Terms
- PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) - A computer designed for industrial automation that controls machinery through programmable logic
- Cam Timer - A mechanical device with rotating drum and adjustable cams that control switches for timed motor sequences
- Stepladder Programming - A graphical programming method that resembles a ladder with rungs containing inputs, logic, and outputs
- Sink/Source - Two different ways of connecting sensors to PLC inputs, affecting compatibility with PNP and NPN sensors
- Extension Block - Additional hardware modules that can be added to PLCs to provide more inputs, outputs, or specialized functions
- Applied Instructions - Advanced software functions built into PLC programming software for complex operations
- States - Programming concept where different parts of a program are active at different times, allowing for complex branching logic
- Pulse Catch - A high-speed interrupt function that captures brief sensor pulses that might be missed in normal scanning
- BrightSign Player - A specialized video player used for reliable video playback in industrial and commercial applications
