### Aristotle's Life and Works
- Born in 384 BCE, 15 years after trial of Socrates
- Native of Stagira in Macedonia
- Studied at Plato's Academy for 20 years
- Left Athens after Plato's death
- Tutored Alexander the Great
- Established the Lyceum, his own school in Athens
- Fled Athens near the end of his life when charged (unlike Socrates who accepted death)
- Wrote systematic treatises on multiple subjects (biology, ethics, metaphysics, politics)

### Aristotle's Approach to Politics
- More like a political scientist than Plato
- Collected 158 constitutions from the ancient world
- Works intended as practical political instruction
- Takes seriously the dignity of the city and political life
- Shows how philosophy can be useful to citizens and statesmen
- Silent on the political crises of his own time
- Historically viewed as an authority ("the philosopher", "master of those who know")
- Later criticized by Hobbes as "repugnant to government"
- Interpreted differently by various thinkers over centuries

### Man as the Political Animal
- Central claim: "Man is, by nature, the political animal"
- The polis (city) exists by nature
- Humans are political because we possess logos (speech/reason)
- Speech allows us to distinguish moral categories (just/unjust, advantageous/harmful)
- Two accounts of how the city is natural:
  - Historical development: family → tribe → village → polis
  - Teleological: the city allows humans to achieve their telos (end/purpose)
- Not making a socio-biological claim about instincts
- Speech gives us freedom and latitude in behavior not available to other species

### The Connection Between Logos and Politics
- Logos entails two fundamental human attributes:
  - Power to know and recognize others of our kind
  - Power of love, affection, friendship, and sympathy
- Political association must be particularistic
- The polis is necessarily small and specific
- Trust and friendship can only exist in a limited circle
- A universal state cannot allow for self-perfection
- Cities will always exist in a world with other cities
- War and the virtues necessary for war are natural

### The Naturalness of Slavery
- Slavery follows from the belief that inequality is the basic rule between humans
- Aristotle frames his analysis as a debate between opposing views
- Rejects justification of slavery based on war or conquest
- Denies that slavery is appropriate based on ethnicity
- Claims "nature often misses the mark" in distinguishing free from slave
- Defends natural slavery based on hierarchy of rationality
- Self-rule requires restraint of passions
- Questions whether the hierarchy of rationality is innate or created by education
- Seems to favor an aristocracy of the educated elite
- Raises questions about modern elite institutions like Yale

### Freedom and Politics
- Freedom comes through political responsibility
- Freedom does not mean living as one likes
- Requires moderation, restraint, and self-control
- Critique of democratic theory of freedom as "living as one likes"
- City must be small enough to be governed by a common language of justice
- Citizens can only reach perfection through participation in ruling offices

### Terms
- Polis - The ancient Greek city-state; a small, independent political community that Aristotle considers the natural form of human association.
- Logos - Reason or speech; the distinctly human capacity that enables political life by allowing humans to create moral categories.
- Telos - The end or purpose; the final cause or aim of something. For humans, this can only be achieved through political participation.
- Zoon politikon - "Political animal"; Aristotle's description of human beings as naturally suited for life in a political community.
- Natural slavery - Aristotle's controversial doctrine that some people are naturally suited to be slaves based on their rational capacity.
- Mixed regime - A political system combining elements of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy to create stability.
- Rule of law - The principle that law rather than individual rulers should govern a community.
- Lyceum - The school founded by Aristotle in Athens after he left Plato's Academy.
