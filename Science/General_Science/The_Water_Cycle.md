### Overview
- The amount of water on Earth remains constant over time
- Water is recycled through the water cycle
- Water is the only substance on Earth that naturally exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas

### The Water Cycle Process
- Continuous movement of water from ground to atmosphere and back
- Water changes form throughout the cycle
- Driven by solar energy, gravity, weather, and geography

### Main Components of the Water Cycle
- Evaporation
  - Sun's energy warms water on ocean surface
  - Water turns into water vapor
  - Water vapor is less dense than liquid water and rises
- Condensation
  - As water vapor rises, atmosphere cools
  - Water vapor condenses into tiny liquid droplets
  - Forms clouds
- Precipitation
  - Clouds collect more water droplets
  - Water is released from clouds due to gravity
  - Returns to Earth as rain or snow
- Runoff and Collection
  - Water flows back to oceans, lakes, rivers
  - Snow may melt and flow to water bodies
  - Some water becomes groundwater

### Alternative Water Cycle Paths
- Snow can become part of glaciers for thousands of years
- Rain can seep into ground and become groundwater
- Groundwater can be absorbed by plant roots
- Transpiration allows water to leave plants as vapor through stomata
- Groundwater can flow to aquifers, lakes, rivers, or oceans

### Importance of the Water Cycle
- Fresh water is a limited resource
- Changes in water cycle impact:
  - Economy
  - Energy production
  - Health
  - Recreation
  - Transportation
  - Agriculture
  - Drinking water

### Terms
- Water Cycle - The continuous movement of water from the ground to the atmosphere and back again
- Evaporation - The process where the sun's energy warms water and turns it into water vapor
- Condensation - The process where water vapor cools and forms tiny liquid water droplets in clouds
- Precipitation - The release of water from clouds back to Earth as rain, snow, or other forms
- Transpiration - The process where water absorbed by plants transitions to water vapor and leaves through tiny holes (stomata) in leaves
- Groundwater - Water that has seeped into the ground
- Aquifer - An underground layer of water-bearing rock
- Stomata - Tiny holes in plant leaves through which water vapor can escape
- Water Vapor - Water in its gaseous state
