## Overview

This lesson covers how to modify and edit 3D CAD drawings without starting over, focusing on three main areas: editing sketches, using modify tools, and understanding the timeline feature.

## Editing Sketches

### Accessing Sketch Editing
- Right-click in the tree structure and select "Edit Sketch"
- Use the timeline at the bottom left corner to access sketch editing
- Timeline shows step-by-step process of CAD creation
- When editing sketch, later features (extrusions, components) become grayed out
- Timeline essentially "rewinds" to the point when the sketch was created

### Parametric Design Benefits
- Changes to sketches automatically propagate to 3D objects
- Double-click dimensions to modify them directly
- Example: Changing key depth from original dimension to 25mm
- Robust sketches allow modifications without failures
- Quick and easy way to modify parts by going back to original sketch

## Modify Tools

### Fillet Tool
- Located in the Modify dropdown menu in the ribbon
- Adds radius corners or rounded corners to edges
- Click on individual lines to add fillets
- Specify radius dimension (e.g., 2mm)
- Creates new step in timeline for editing later
- Can edit fillet features by right-clicking in timeline

### Chamfer Tool
- Adds straight line edges instead of radius
- Creates 45-degree angled edges
- Options include equal distance, different distances, and custom angles
- Similar workflow to fillet tool

### Shell Tool
- Creates pockets by offsetting walls of solid body
- Useful in CNC applications
- Click on face to add thickness (e.g., 1mm)
- Creates 1mm outline, essentially creating a pocket
- Alternative to creating sketch and cut extrude
- Faster method for creating pockets

### Modify Tool Features
- Dropdown menu in ribbon with multiple options
- Tool tips provide descriptions of each function
- Each modification adds new step to timeline
- Timeline allows editing of any feature at any point

## Timeline Management

### Timeline Functionality
- Bar at bottom of screen showing step-by-step CAD process
- Shows progression from sketch to final 3D object
- Each feature (sketch, extrusion, fillet, chamfer, shell) appears as separate step
- Allows stepping backwards and forwards through design process
- Useful for debugging when something breaks
- Can step back to good point and work forward fixing mistakes

### Timeline Editing
- Right-click any timeline step to edit that feature
- Grayed-out features indicate they haven't been created yet at that point
- Edit feature allows modification of parameters
- Timeline provides visual representation of design history

## Master Answer Key

1. A – The timeline displays a step-by-step process of how the design was created, showing the progression from sketch to final 3D object.

2. D – You can access sketch editing by right-clicking in the tree structure and selecting "Edit Sketch," though the timeline also provides this access.

3. C – When editing a sketch, later features become grayed out because the timeline "rewinds" to the point when the sketch was created.

4. D – Parametric design is the ability to make modifications that automatically carry through to the 3D object, ensuring changes propagate throughout the design.

5. B – Fillet is the tool that adds rounded corners or radius to edges, creating smooth transitions.

6. C – Fillet creates rounded edges while chamfer creates straight edges, typically at angles like 45 degrees.

7. D – The shell tool is particularly useful for CNC machining applications where pockets need to be created efficiently.

8. D – The shell tool creates pockets by offsetting walls of a solid body, essentially creating a hollow interior with specified thickness.

9. D – You can modify a fillet after creation by right-clicking on it in the timeline and selecting "Edit Feature" to change its parameters.

10. C – Using shell is faster than creating a sketch and cut extrude for achieving the same pocket effect.

11. B – When stepping backwards in the timeline, features created after that point become grayed out, showing they haven't been created yet at that stage.

12. C – Tool tips in the modify dropdown menu provide descriptions of each tool's function to help users understand what each tool does.

13. A – False. You can edit sketches both through the tree structure (right-click) and through the timeline, providing multiple access methods.

14. B – True. Parametric design allows changes to automatically update throughout the entire 3D model, maintaining design consistency.

15. C – Double-clicking on a dimension in sketch editing mode allows you to modify the dimension value directly.

16. D – Chamfer creates straight line edges, typically at 45-degree angles, unlike fillet which creates rounded edges.

17. C – Having a robust sketch at the beginning allows changes to be made without everything failing, supporting the parametric design process.
