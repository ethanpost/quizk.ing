# CAD Tutorial: Construction Lines, Patterns, Trim & Extend - Lesson 7

## Multiple Approaches to CAD Design

### Core Philosophy
- There's always more than one way to design a part in CAD
- Different methods can achieve the same result
- Choose the approach that works best for your specific situation

### Washer Design Methods

#### Method 1: Two Circles with Dimensions
- Create outer circle with dimension (100mm example)
- Create inner circle with separate dimension (60mm example)
- Simple approach with two independent dimensions
- Requires manual constraint management

#### Method 2: Offset Tool
- Create outer circle with dimension
- Use offset tool under modify section
- Type negative value (-20mm) to create inner circle
- Automatically creates concentric constraint
- Inner circle references outer circle as driven dimension
- More parametric approach

### Construction Lines

#### Purpose and Benefits
- Used for reference geometry that doesn't affect final profile
- Appear as dotted lines in CAD
- Don't interfere with profile selection during extrusion
- Still usable as reference points for constraints

#### Creating Construction Lines
- Draw standard line through center of part
- Add vertical constraint
- Add midpoint constraint to origin
- Convert to construction line using sketch palette
- Select line → sketch palette → construction under line type

### Patterns in CAD

#### Circle Pattern
- Creates multiple copies of geometry around a center point
- Located in create section of toolbar
- Allows specification of quantity and distribution
- Can be full (360°) or partial pattern
- Counts initial geometry plus additional copies

#### Rectangular Pattern
- Creates grid-like patterns in two axes
- Useful for creating arrays of features
- Allows control of spacing and quantity in both directions
- Example: 3x2 pattern creates 6 total features

#### Mirror Pattern
- Reflects geometry across a reference line
- Uses construction lines as mirror axis
- Creates symmetrical features efficiently

### Trim and Extend Tools

#### Trim Tool
- Located in modify section
- Acts like scissors to remove unwanted lines
- Cleans up drawings for better visibility
- Removes unnecessary geometry from profiles
- Can affect constraint relationships

#### Extend Tool
- Opposite of trim tool
- Extends lines to meet other geometry
- Useful for connecting separate profiles
- Located next to trim tool in modify section

### Key Design Process

#### Creating Keys on Washer
- Use construction line as reference
- Draw half of key shape with perpendicular lines
- Add dimensions for positioning and sizing
- Use mirror tool to create symmetrical key
- Apply circle pattern to create multiple keys at 120° intervals

#### Dimensioning Strategy
- Reference outer circle for positioning
- Use half-width dimensions for symmetry
- Re-establish constraints after trimming operations

## Master Answer Key

1. B – The lesson emphasizes that there are multiple valid approaches to achieve the same CAD design result, encouraging students to find what works best for them.

2. B – The offset tool automatically creates a concentric constraint, maintaining the relationship between the outer and inner circles.

3. B – Construction lines are visually distinguished by appearing as dotted lines, making them easy to identify as reference geometry.

4. B – Construction lines are specifically designed not to affect final profiles during extrusion, which is their key advantage.

5. B – A circle pattern with quantity 3 creates 3 total features: the original plus 2 additional copies.

6. B – The offset tool's main advantage is automatically maintaining the concentric relationship between circles, unlike manual dimensioning.

7. B – The circle pattern tool is located in the create section of the toolbar, along with other pattern tools.

8. B – Trimming lines created with offset tool can break the constraint relationship, requiring re-establishment of dimensions.

9. A – The trim tool is specifically mentioned as useful for cleaning up drawings to improve visibility and ease of modification.

10. C – Rectangular patterns create grid-like arrangements in two axes, while circle patterns create radial arrangements.

11. A – The extend tool is described as the exact opposite of trim, allowing lines to be lengthened rather than shortened.

12. B – Three keys are spaced at 120-degree intervals (360° ÷ 3 = 120°), creating equal spacing around the circle.

13. C – The offset tool automatically creates concentric constraints, ensuring circles share the same center point.

14. A – Construction lines remain fully functional as reference points for constraints despite not affecting profiles.

15. B – Cleaning up drawings improves visibility and makes future modifications easier, as explicitly stated in the lesson.

16. B – Drawing two separate circles requires manual constraint management, unlike the automatic constraints of the offset tool.

17. C – The offset method maintains the dimensional relationship, so changing the outer circle automatically adjusts the inner circle.

18. A – The extend tool can connect separate profiles by extending lines to meet other geometry.

19. B – Drawing half a feature and using the mirror tool is more efficient than drawing complete symmetrical shapes.

20. B – Circle patterns allow specification of both quantity (number of copies) and distribution (angle range) around a center point.
