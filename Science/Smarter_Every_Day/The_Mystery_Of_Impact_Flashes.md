### Observations of Impact Flashes
- Various types of impacts produce light flashes
  - Leather baseball hitting leather glove
  - Baseball hitting plastic bucket of sprinkles
  - Bullet versus Prince Rupert drop (metal vs. glass)
  - Bullet versus bullet (lead vs. lead)
  - Glass sphere versus glass sphere
  - Wintergreen lifesavers hit with hammer
  - Mayonnaise being shot (diesel effect)

### Different Types of Luminescence
- Triboluminescence
  - Fracture of crystalline structures (like wintergreen lifesavers)
  - Light appears at fracture locations, not just impact point
- Fractoluminescence
  - Light produced when materials fracture
- Mechanoluminescence
  - Light produced from mechanical action on solids
- Other possible explanations
  - Friction creating light
  - Electrostatic discharge
  - Cop-Etchell effect (sand hitting helicopter rotors)

### Taylor Impact Test
- Developed by GI Taylor in 1947
- Method to describe material strength upon impact
- Creates relationship between dynamic stress, yield stress, and velocity
- Uses cylinder hitting flat plate
- Used for finite element analysis modeling

### Experimental Setup
- 12-gauge shotgun bolted to steel table
- Custom-built impact chamber
- Uses sabots to guide projectiles
- High-speed cameras to capture impacts
- Various projectile materials tested:
  - Polycarbonate
  - PET-G plastic
  - Wood
  - Glass marbles

### Key Experiment: Polycarbonate Rod Impact
- When shot against stainless steel plate at high velocity
- Created bright flash with directional pattern
- Flash appeared to "fart out" from one side of impact
- Direction related to obliquity (angle) of cylinder impact
- Researchers Guo and Chin at Purdue used similar flash patterns to measure impact obliquity

### Adiabatic Compression Demonstration
- Fire syringe demonstration
  - Compressing gas creates heat (adiabatic compression)
  - Cotton ignites from rapid compression of air
  - Enhanced effect with oxygen-rich environment
  - Argon gas created different effect

### Testing Variables in Impact Flash Experiments
- Different materials (polycarbonate, PETG, wood, glass)
- Different gas environments (air, oxygen, argon)
- Different impact velocities
- Different impact angles

### Main Hypothesis
- Impact flashes likely caused by compression of gases
- Gas trapped between impacting surfaces gets compressed
- Compression raises temperature (adiabatic compression)
- Orthogonal (90Â°) impacts create more dramatic compression
- Oxygen-rich environments produced larger flashes
- Need vacuum chamber tests to confirm gas compression theory

### Implications and Future Research
- Need to test impacts in vacuum to eliminate gas as factor
- Different gases produce different flash effects
- Impact angle affects flash direction and intensity
- Could be used as diagnostic tool for impact processes

### Terms
- Triboluminescence - Light produced when crystalline materials are fractured
- Fractoluminescence - Light produced specifically from fracturing materials
- Mechanoluminescence - Light produced by mechanical action on solids
- Adiabatic Compression - Compression of gas without heat entering or exiting the system
- Taylor Impact Test - Method developed to test material strength upon impact
- Obliquity - Angle of impact that deviates from perpendicular
- Sabot - Device that fills the space between a projectile and the barrel of a firing device
- Shock Ignition - Ignition of gases from compression in a shock wave
- Noble Gas - Gas that typically doesn't react chemically (like argon)
