## Outline

### Introduction
- Material selection is half the battle in design
- Different materials come in different raw stock forms
- Raw stock forms affect CAD designs

### Three Main Categories of Raw Stock Forms
- Sheet and plate
- Bar and billet
- Tube

### Sheet and Plate
- Definition: Material that is much thinner in thickness than its overall width and length profile
- Width and length profiles can vary greatly (from 12 x 12 inches up to 5' x 10')
- Typically made in big coil fashion through extrusion
- Come in very set thicknesses from manufacturer that cannot be changed
- Designers must select from available thicknesses (e.g., for CRS: 0.19 or 0.135 instead of 0.125)
- Differentiation between sheet and plate occurs at about quarter inch (0.25") thickness mark
- Definition varies by location and who defines it
- Both sheet and plate are much larger and wider parts that are thinner in profile
- Generally do not see subtractive operations on sheet and plate
- Plate towards half inch thick or more may have secondary operations like CNC milling for pockets
- Generally cut in 2D and stays in 2D
- Often have secondary operations like bending, tapping, hardware installation, or zinc plating
- Secondary operation type material

### Bar and Billet
- Thickness matches overall outside length and width profiles more closely (more proportional)
- First thing to pick out is the outside profile
- Come in many different shapes: rectangular, square, rod, U channel, 90° angle or L channels, and many more
- Shapes created through extrusion process
- Come cut into set lengths
- After picking profile, select width and thickness (e.g., 3x3 square)
- Then pick length
- Length gets cut out of a long bar
- Profile cutting done using a band saw
- Results in two rougher saw areas with an extrusion finish on the ends
- When CNC milling a billet piece, typically need to oversize it
- Need material to hold onto during machining
- Remove all material and bring it down to CNC finish all the way around to hold tolerances
- Unless you have a surface you don't care about on your part

### Tube
- Last category of raw stock options
- Has many different profiles to pick from
- Profile options include: square, rectangle, circle, triangular, and more
- Different shapes have different dimensions to pick out
- First dimension: overall outside diameter (for circle) or overall outside width and thickness
- Has a thickness as well
- Similar to sheet metal, thicknesses are dictated by the manufacturer
- Need to fall within using those thicknesses in designs to match everything up nicely

### Conclusion
- Material plus machines equals reality
- Covered how to pick out material and how raw stock forms come
- Next lesson will cover how machines dictate different designs and how to draw things out in CAD

### Terms
- Sheet - Material that is much thinner in thickness than its overall width and length profile, typically less than a quarter inch thick
- Plate - Material similar to sheet but typically quarter inch thick or greater, still much larger and wider than it is thick
- Bar - A raw stock form where thickness matches overall outside length and width profiles more closely, comes in various cross-sectional shapes
- Billet - A chunk of material (like aluminum) with a specific outside profile that comes in set lengths, used for CNC milling operations
- Tube - A hollow raw stock form that comes in various profiles (square, rectangle, circle, triangular) with a specified wall thickness
- Extrusion - A manufacturing process used to create sheet/plate in coil fashion and to create various bar/billet profiles
- Band saw - A cutting tool used to cut bar and billet materials into set lengths from long bars
- Secondary operations - Additional manufacturing processes performed after initial cutting, such as bending, tapping, hardware installation, zinc plating, or CNC milling for pockets
- Cold rolled steel (CRS) - A type of steel material that comes in set thicknesses (e.g., 0.19 or 0.135 inches) that cannot be changed
- CNC finish - A machined surface finish achieved through computer numerical control machining, used to hold tight tolerances
- Oversize - Making a billet piece larger than the final part dimensions to allow material for holding during CNC machining and achieving proper finish

28. **C** - The video states that sheet and plate sizes can be "Everything from say 12 x 12 in all the way up to 5' 10t."

29. **A** - The video states "generally speaking, we're talking about an object that is cut in 2D and that stays in 2D."

30. **A** - The video explains that thicknesses "come off at very set thicknesses from the manufacturer. These cannot be changed," so you cannot always get exactly what you want.

31. **A** - The video states that tube thicknesses are "similar to sheet metal, those thicknesses are dictated by the manufacturer," making this statement true.
