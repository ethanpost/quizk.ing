## Understanding Socrates' Trial
- Trial centers on whether Socrates corrupted youth and was impious
- Jury vote divided on Socrates' guilt (more believed in his innocence than in Athens)
- Professor conducted informal poll showing similar division in modern classroom

## Socratic Citizenship
- Socrates proposes a new conception of citizenship
  - Opposes traditional Homeric conception of citizen loyalty
  - Advocates for rational/philosophical citizenship based on independent reason
  - Claims to have pursued private matters rather than public ones

### Principled Abstention from Public Life
- Policy of abstaining from participation in collective injustice
  - Refused to join judgment condemning ten Athenian generals
  - Refused to assist Thirty Tyrants in arresting Leon of Salamis
- Socrates' individual moral integrity serves as a litmus test for political engagement
- Central question: Can a citizen put conscience above law?

### The Gadfly Analogy
- Socrates defines himself as a gadfly who improves the quality of life in Athens
- Claims to be a "gift from the god" who awakens and challenges citizens
- Uses religious imagery while on trial for impiety
  - Divine calling following Delphic Oracle
  - Declares he will "obey the god rather than you"

## The Crito: City's Case Against Socrates
- Contrasts with Apology in presenting the city's case against the philosopher
- Takes place in prison with only one listener (Crito)
- Central argument: law requires absolute obedience
  - No state can exist without rules
  - Citizens cannot choose which laws to follow
  - Breaking even one law undermines all law
  - Laws have "begat" citizens, deserve paternal respect

## Tension Between Two Moral Codes
- Philosophical perspective: individual reason as highest authority
- Political perspective: laws and community take priority over individual
- Two irreconcilable alternatives for the worthy life:
  - Examined life of philosophy
  - Political life of citizenship
- Each person must choose between these paths

## Lessons for Modern Society
- Most modern readers instinctively side with Socrates
- Athenians took Socrates seriously by putting him on trial
- The trial raises questions about limits of toleration
- Danger of "soft nihilism" where all views are equally valid
- Balance between freedom of speech and societal standards

### Terms
- Gadfly - Socrates' self-description as someone who "awakens" Athens by questioning and challenging citizens
- Principled disobedience - Socrates' policy of refusing to comply with laws or orders he deemed unjust
- Examined life - Socrates' ideal that only a life subjected to philosophical questioning is worth living
- Civic piety - Respect and reverence for the city's laws, traditions, and institutions
- Beautiful soul - Hegel's ironic term for someone who puts private moral incorruptibility above all else
- Soft nihilism - View that every preference must be considered equally legitimate, abandoning standards of judgment
