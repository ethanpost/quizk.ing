## Outline

### Introduction to Papal Authority
- Belief in apostolic authority of the papacy is the singular thing that makes someone Roman Catholic or not
- The bishop of Rome (pope) claims divine right to intervene anywhere, anytime in the global church with absolute authority with no appeal
- Roman church holds that the pope has the power to teach without error
- These expansive powers are not clearly set out in scripture

### Four Intertwined Teachings
- Apostolic succession
- Petrine primacy
- Roman primacy
- Infallibility of the church
- These beliefs gave rise to papal infallibility and universal immediate jurisdiction
- If just one of these is wrong, the entire papal project collapses

### Apostolic Succession
- Both Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theology rest on idea of particular form of church government established by apostles
- Direct succession of bishops downstream from apostles elevated in hierarchy over priests and deacons
- Protestants emphasize apostolic succession of doctrine, focusing on apostolic teaching of gospel contained in scripture
- For Catholics, valid ministry is dependent on whether bishops can trace their ordination back to apostles
- This endows bishops with authority to operate in place of apostles to administer the eucharist and fully remit sins
- Succession of office, especially for bishops of Rome, is seen as necessarily preserving the gospel
- Council of Trent decreed that hierarchy of bishops, priests, and ministers was instituted by divine ordination

### Petrine Primacy
- Peter is seen as central leader of early church, beloved by Christ, one of most prominent of twelve apostles
- Petrine primacy claims Peter received uniquely authoritative office from Christ that directly placed him over other apostles
- Not just organic position of leadership, but official office
- Council of Trent: Peter was appointed by Christ as prince of all apostles and visible head of whole church militant

### Roman Petrine Primacy
- Combination of apostolic succession and Petrine primacy
- If Peter was lord and prince over all other apostles and visible head of global church, and Roman bishop was uniquely ordained by Peter, then Roman bishop fully inherits Peter's authority
- Vatican 1: Peter has perpetual line of successors in primacy over universal church, and Roman pontiff is successor of Peter in this primacy
- Apostolic primacy conferred on Peter, authority of apostles directly passed down in lines of bishops, and Peter's authority uniquely passed down in succession of Roman bishops
- This puts Roman bishops in charge of all other bishops
- This is basis of all other papal claims regarding nature of their authority in jurisdiction and teaching

### Problems with the Schema: Anachronism
- Schema is anachronistic because church structures changed organically with changing circumstances of early church
- Many in early church read their situation back into New Testament texts inaccurately
- Hierarchies seen by Council of Nicaea were product of human custom, not divine command

### Three Office vs Two Office Church Government
- Catholics espouse three office form: bishops, priests, and deacons in hierarchy
- Most Protestants believe only two offices were divinely established: elders and deacons
- Some treat ministers as uniquely called type of executive elder
- Problem with Catholic view: bishop simply didn't exist as distinct office
- Most scholarship doesn't hold that there was single bishop of Rome until latter half of 2nd century
- If this is case, then papacy's claims fail on most basic level

### New Testament Evidence: Bishops and Elders Conflated
- New Testament conflates bishops and elders
- Two Greek words: episcopos (overseer or bishop) and presburos (presbyter, elder, or priest)
- Earliest Christian writings (1 Clement, Shepherd of Hermas, Epistle of Barnabas) show same thing: single bishop in charge was not original
- Overseer and elder were treated as same office
- Distinction starts early: many churches started to elevate one overseer or bishop over elders (like head pastor) soon after apostles

### Ignatius of Antioch
- Early 2nd century writings of Ignatius clearly distinguish elders and overseers
- But even at this stage, it isn't functioning as Roman Catholics now conceive of it
- Ignatius's writing: presbyters are ones described as being in place of apostles
- No clear mandate for council of presbyters to be subject to bishop
- It wasn't until end of second century that bishop as distinct office became universal
- Around a century after Peter's death, office of bishop took shape in Rome as we now understand it

### St. Jerome's Testimony
- Church father St. Jerome, translator of Latin Vulgate, came to similar conclusion
- Recorded in letter to Evangelis and biblical commentaries
- Acts 20: Paul uses two terms interchangeably, tells Ephesian presbyters they have been made overseers by Holy Spirit
- Titus 1:5-7: Paul uses terms overseers and elders interchangeably when describing qualifications for church office
- 1 Timothy 4:14: Timothy was ordained by college of elders, not from single bishop as became later practice
- Philippians 1:1: There were multiple bishops at one church, unlike later single bishop model
- Pattern seen throughout most apostolic fathers apart from Ignatius
- First Clement (traditionally 96 AD from Rome) shows same two office model

### Why Bishops Were Created
- St. Jerome explains: as practical necessity at time to preserve unity
- Originally bishop derived authority from choice of presbyters
- Bishop is to presbyters what arch deacon is to deacons
- Practical administrative distinction
- When one presbyter was chosen to preside over rest, this was done to remedy schism and prevent each individual from rending church of Christ
- At Alexandria from time of Mark evangelist until episcopates of Heracles and Dionis, presbyters always named as bishop one of their own number chosen by themselves
- Bishops are all alike successors of apostles through their ordination to presbyterate whether in Rome or lesser city

### Summary of Church Government Development
- Apostles established two-tier system with councils of presbyters or bishops ruling deacons and laity
- Often with charismatic or important individuals taking leading role within council
- Formal distinction was only created later but came about quite naturally
- System of bishops is consistent with scripture as prudent means of church government
- But claims that rest on special and exclusive succession of bishops are on shaky ground biblically and historically

### Petrine Primacy: Scriptural Problems
- Idea that Peter had power over other apostles similar to how current pope has power over other bishops is patently false and contrary to scripture
- Any form of Petrine primacy is tenuous in text
- Peter is always listed first in list of apostles and has most action of any apostle in New Testament
- But nowhere does he have authority over other apostles
- James presides over Jerusalem Council in Acts, not Peter
- Paul rebukes Peter publicly in Galatians for significant error
- Peter is given keys to bind and loose, but rest of disciples are also given this authority in Matthew 18
- "You are Peter and on this rock I will build my church" requires reading a lot into text to get to lord and prince over other apostles and singular succession of bishops as singular visible head over global church

### Church Fathers on the Rock
- Church fathers didn't have consensus on what "rock" was
- Interpretations included: Peter himself, Peter's faith, Jesus
- Rather ambiguous, and pun on Peter's name is likely big part of it
- Cyprian of Carthage: other apostles were what Peter was, furnished with equal share of honor and power

### Ecumenical Dialogue on Petrine Primacy
- 1980s: Anglican and Catholic representatives acknowledged in official ecumenical dialogue
- New Testament contains no explicit record of transmission of Peter's leadership
- Transmission of apostolic authority in general is not very clear
- Petrine texts were subjected to differing interpretations as early as time of church fathers
- Possible to think primacy of bishop of Rome is not contrary to New Testament and is part of God's purpose regarding church's unity and Catholicity
- But New Testament texts offer no sufficient basis for this
- Neither scriptures nor tradition of earliest fathers offer sufficient basis to make any claim of Petrine primacy

### Roman Bishops as Bearers of Special Apostolic Authority
- Major problem with Roman Petrine succession applies even if you believe there was succession of bishops from beginning
- Possible to be successors of apostles in two senses
- First sense (acceptable to Protestants): Common and ordinary ministry of preaching word, administering sacraments, and exercising church discipline belongs to all true ministers of Christ
- These are called successors of divine apostles by fathers
- Second sense: Special and extraordinary work of apostleship for the twelve
- Testified to in Acts 1:22 and 1 Corinthians 9:1
- Apostles were eyewitnesses of resurrected Christ (crucial part of their status, including Paul)
- Apostles had unique relationship with Israel
- When Matthias was appointed to fill Judas's place, he needed to be eyewitness to resurrection and maintain number 12
- Matthew 19:28: Jesus says apostles will sit on 12 thrones, judging 12 tribes of Israel
- Apostolic ministry marked by: universal ministry, divine revelation, gifts of miracles, being unique witnesses to resurrection, being appointed to judge 12 tribes
- Bishops and elders only succeed apostles in ministry, not in these other things
- Not proper to assume extraordinary nature of Peter's ministry or authority or any promises to him personally would be passed along to his successors
- Especially when successors did not witness resurrected Christ, nor did they receive public divine revelation

### Roman Monopoly Problem
- Rome strongly describes itself as seat of Peter, but unclear how unique it truly is
- According to early tradition, both Peter and Paul were martyred in city, cementing association between them and Rome
- Of other major patriarchates (now separated from Rome in Eastern Orthodox and Coptic churches), two have claims of Petrine succession
- In scripture, we learn of Peter's ministry in Antioch
- Bishops of Antioch claim Petrine succession
- Coptic popes of Alexandria claim succession from Peter through Mark the Gospel writer
- Even if Peter had unique status of authority, and even if this were passed down by episcopal succession, unclear why Roman succession would uniquely bear Peter's authority in way other patriarchs do not
- Thing that distinguished Rome in early church was largely secular and political
- Rome had status as cultural center and capital of empire, not claims to Petrine succession per se

### Conclusion
- Each topic could be explored much more thoroughly
- Many books have been written on development of church in first centuries after Christ
- Next episode will get into issues with later claims: primarily supremacy and infallibility
- These are strong reasons to reject contemporary papacy even if this video wasn't convincing
- Belief that episcopal church government was established by Christ runs against testimony of scriptures and early church
- Should believe St. Jerome when he tells us bishops were created as practical organizational measure rather than as foundation of church legitimacy and authority
