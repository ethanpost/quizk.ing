## Understanding the CAD Workspace

### Origins
- Definition: A point in space that serves as the home base for CAD operations
- Location: Where X, Y, and Z axes intersect at coordinates (0,0,0)
- Purpose: Similar to GPS coordinates - tells you where you are in CAD's 3D space
- Visual representation: A small dot in the center of the workspace
- Control: Can be shown or hidden using the eyeball icon in the browser panel

### Coordinate System
- Three-dimensional system using X, Y, and Z axes
- X-axis: Horizontal axis (left to right)
- Y-axis: Horizontal axis (front to back) 
- Z-axis: Vertical axis (up and down)
- All axes are perpendicular to each other (90 degrees apart)
- Coordinates are written as (X, Y, Z) values

### Axes
- Three lines extending from the origin point
- X-axis: Extends horizontally from origin
- Y-axis: Extends horizontally from origin (perpendicular to X)
- Z-axis: Extends vertically from origin
- Visual representation: Colored lines (typically red, green, blue)
- Can be displayed or hidden independently

### Planes
- Flat surfaces created by pairs of axes
- XY Plane: Created by X and Y axes (horizontal plane)
- XZ Plane: Created by X and Z axes (vertical plane)
- YZ Plane: Created by Y and Z axes (vertical plane)
- Purpose: Serve as "pieces of paper" for drawing sketches
- Visual representation: Semi-transparent colored surfaces

### Room Analogy
- Floor represents the XY plane
- Walls represent the XZ and YZ planes
- Where walls meet represents the axes
- Vertical wall intersection = Z-axis
- Wall coming toward you = X-axis
- Wall going away = Y-axis

### Navigation Tools

#### View Cube
- Location: Top right corner of the workspace
- Appearance: Interactive cube showing X, Y, Z axes
- Functions: Click faces to change view orientation
- Rotation: Use corner arrows to rotate around axes
- Home button: Returns to default ISO view

#### Pan Tool
- Purpose: Move the view left, right, up, or down
- Access: Bottom center toolbar or mouse controls
- Mouse method: Hold middle mouse button and drag
- Alternative: Use pan tool button and left-click drag

#### Zoom Tool
- Purpose: Zoom in and out of the workspace
- Access: Bottom center toolbar or mouse controls
- Mouse method: Scroll wheel up/down
- Alternative: Use zoom tool button and left-click drag

#### Rotate Tool
- Purpose: Rotate the view around the model
- Access: Bottom center toolbar or mouse controls
- Mouse method: Hold Shift + middle mouse button and drag
- Alternative: Use rotate tool button and left-click drag

#### Home View
- Purpose: Reset view to default orientation
- Access: Home button on view cube or bottom toolbar
- Function: Centers origin and sets ISO view
- Use when: Lost or disoriented in the workspace

### Mouse Controls Summary
- Scroll wheel: Zoom in/out
- Middle mouse button + drag: Pan
- Shift + middle mouse button + drag: Rotate
- All functions available through toolbar buttons as alternatives

### Sketching Basics
- Must select a plane before sketching
- Initial plane choice doesn't matter for simple projects
- Plane selection becomes important for complex assemblies
- Sketch tools accessed through top toolbar
- Finish sketch to exit sketching mode

### Terms
- **Origin** – The central reference point (0,0,0) where X, Y, and Z axes intersect in CAD space
- **Axes** – The three perpendicular lines (X, Y, Z) that extend from the origin to define 3D space
- **Planes** – Flat surfaces created by pairs of axes (XY, XZ, YZ) that serve as drawing surfaces
- **View Cube** – Interactive navigation tool in the top right corner for changing view orientation
- **Pan** – Moving the view left, right, up, or down without changing zoom level
- **Zoom** – Making the view larger or smaller
- **Rotate** – Turning the view around the model to see different angles
- **Home View** – Default view that centers the origin and shows an isometric perspective
- **ISO View** – Isometric view showing the model from a 3D perspective
- **Sketch** – 2D drawing created on a plane that can be used to build 3D features

## Master Answer Key

1. C – The origin is a point in space that serves as the home base, similar to GPS coordinates, located at (0,0,0) where all axes intersect.

2. A – There are three axes in the CAD coordinate system: X, Y, and Z, which are all perpendicular to each other.

3. D – The three axes are called X, Y, and Z, representing the three dimensions of 3D space.

4. A – The XY plane is created by the intersection of the X and Y axes, representing a horizontal plane.

5. B – False. The origin point has coordinates of (0,0,0), not (1,1,1).

6. B – The eyeball icon controls whether the origin is visible (dark eyeball) or hidden (grayed out eyeball).

7. B – In the room analogy, the floor represents the XY plane, which is horizontal.

8. C – The view cube is located in the top right corner of the workspace and appears as an interactive cube.

9. D – The home button resets the view to the default orientation, centering the origin and showing an ISO view.

10. B – Panning is done by holding the middle mouse button and dragging to move the view left, right, up, or down.

11. C – Zooming is done using the scroll wheel - scroll up to zoom in, scroll down to zoom out.

12. A – Rotating requires holding Shift and the middle mouse button, then dragging to rotate the view around the model.

13. D – Before sketching, you must select a plane (XY, XZ, or YZ) to serve as your drawing surface.

14. A – True. All three axes are perpendicular to each other, meeting at 90-degree angles at the origin.

15. C – ISO view stands for isometric view, which shows the model from a 3D perspective.

16. B – For vertical surfaces, you would use either the XZ plane or YZ plane, as these are the vertical planes.

17. C – Planes serve as surfaces for drawing sketches, like "pieces of paper" in 3D space.

18. A – True. For simple projects, the initial choice of plane doesn't matter, but it becomes important for complex assemblies.

19. B – When you finish a sketch, you exit sketching mode and return to the main workspace view.
