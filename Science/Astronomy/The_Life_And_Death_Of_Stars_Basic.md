### How Stars Begin
- Stars start as clouds of gas and dust in space
- Gravity pulls the gas and dust together
- The cloud gets smaller and hotter over millions of years
- When it gets hot enough, nuclear fusion begins
- This creates a star that shines and gives off energy

### What Stars Are Made Of
- Most stars are made of hydrogen and helium
- These are the simplest elements in the universe
- Stars use nuclear fusion to turn hydrogen into helium
- This process releases huge amounts of energy
- The energy keeps the star from collapsing under its own gravity

### Low Mass Stars (Like Our Sun)
- These stars are smaller and cooler
- They burn their fuel slowly over billions of years
- When they run out of hydrogen fuel, they become red giants
- Red giants are much bigger and redder than normal stars
- They can burn helium to make carbon and oxygen
- Eventually they lose their outer layers and become white dwarfs
- White dwarfs are small, hot, and very dense

### High Mass Stars (Much Bigger Than Our Sun)
- These stars are much bigger and hotter
- They burn their fuel very quickly (millions of years)
- They can make many different elements through fusion
- They can create elements up to iron
- When they run out of fuel, they explode as supernovas
- Supernovas are incredibly bright and powerful explosions

### What Happens After Stars Die
- Low mass stars become white dwarfs
- Medium mass stars become neutron stars
- Very massive stars become black holes
- The material from dead stars spreads through space
- This material can form new stars and planets

### Supernovas
- Supernovas are the most powerful explosions in the universe
- They can be brighter than entire galaxies
- They create the heaviest elements like gold and silver
- They leave behind colorful clouds called nebulae
- The material from supernovas helps form new stars

### White Dwarfs
- These are the remains of low mass stars
- They are about the size of Earth but very dense
- One teaspoon would weigh 15 tons
- They slowly cool down over billions of years
- They are held up by electron pressure

### Neutron Stars
- These are the remains of medium mass stars
- They are incredibly dense - like one huge atomic nucleus
- One teaspoon would weigh 10 million tons
- They are about the size of a city
- They are held up by neutron pressure

### Black Holes
- These are the remains of the most massive stars
- They have infinite density in zero volume
- Their gravity is so strong that not even light can escape
- They warp space and time around them
- They are invisible because no light can escape

### Terms
- **Nuclear Fusion** - The process where small atoms combine to make larger atoms, releasing energy
- **Red Giant** - A large, red star that forms when a star runs out of hydrogen fuel
- **White Dwarf** - The small, hot, dense remains of a low mass star
- **Supernova** - A powerful explosion that occurs when a massive star dies
- **Neutron Star** - A very dense star made mostly of neutrons
- **Black Hole** - An object with such strong gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape
- **Nebula** - A cloud of gas and dust in space, often colorful
- **Gravity** - The force that pulls objects toward each other
- **Main Sequence** - The stage in a star's life when it burns hydrogen normally
- **Planetary Nebula** - A colorful cloud of gas left behind when a star dies
