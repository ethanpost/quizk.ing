## Repairing Broken References in CAD Assemblies Overview

### Purpose and Context
- Making changes to CAD designs without starting from beginning
- Understanding parametric design relationships
- Handling linked components and reference updates
- Fixing broken references and error resolution

### Parametric Design Principles
- Changes to Arduino affect main assembly
- Linked components require updates to take effect
- References can be lost during modifications
- Errors appear when references break
- Systematic approach needed for repairs

### Change Propagation Process
- Modify Arduino in separate file
- Save changes to Arduino file
- Return to main assembly file
- Notice warning message about outdated version
- Click update icon to refresh to new version
- Changes propagate through entire assembly

### Successful Change Example
- Modify Arduino length from 2.7 to 5 inches
- Mounting holes automatically adjust
- 3D model updates with new dimensions
- All related features update correctly
- Parametric design maintains relationships

### Broken Reference Scenario
- Delete original reset button hole
- Create new reset button hole in different location
- Save changes to Arduino file
- Update main assembly file
- Yellow warning icons appear in timeline

### Error Identification
- Yellow icons indicate broken references
- Timeline shows error locations
- Sketch and extrude features affected
- Missing profile errors occur
- Reference loss propagates through features

### Reference Repair Process
- Start with leftmost error in timeline
- Work backwards in time, forwards in sequence
- Edit sketch to fix broken reference
- Delete old reference if no longer needed
- Project new reference if replacement needed

### Sketch Repair Steps
- Right-click on yellow sketch icon
- Select "Edit Sketch"
- Delete broken reference
- Project new reference using Create > Project
- Finish sketch to complete repair

### Feature Repair Steps
- Right-click on yellow extrude icon
- Select "Edit Feature"
- Click on new profile to replace missing one
- All other parameters remain unchanged
- Click OK to complete repair

### Systematic Error Resolution
- Always start with leftmost error
- Fix errors in chronological order
- Work from earliest to latest features
- Ensure no yellow icons remain
- Verify all references are valid

### Chapter 2 Summary
- Focus on 3D printed part design
- Emphasis on design reversals and references
- Practice essential for mastery
- Foundation for advanced manufacturing topics
- Preparation for DFM (Design for Manufacturing)

### Next Chapter Preview
- Design for Manufacturing (DFM) focus
- Material and machine specific considerations
- Advanced manufacturing principles
- Building on assembly and reference skills

### Terms
- Parametric Design - CAD approach where changes to one component automatically update related components
- Reference - A connection between different parts of a CAD model that maintains relationships
- Broken Reference - A lost connection between components that causes errors in the model
- Update Icon - Interface element that refreshes linked components to latest version
- Yellow Icon - Warning indicator in timeline showing broken references or errors
- Timeline - Chronological list of features and operations in CAD model
- Profile - The 2D shape used to create 3D features like extrusions
- Missing Profile - Error that occurs when a referenced shape no longer exists
- Edit Feature - Command to modify existing CAD features
- Design for Manufacturing (DFM) - Design principles that consider manufacturing capabilities and limitations

## Master Answer Key

1. **B** - The main purpose is to make changes to CAD designs without starting from the beginning, using parametric relationships.

2. **C** - Changes to linked components require manual updates to take effect in the main assembly.

3. **B** - A warning message appears saying "most recent version is not up to date" when linked files are modified.

4. **C** - You click the update icon to refresh the main assembly with changes from linked components.

5. **C** - When you change the Arduino length, the mounting holes automatically adjust due to parametric relationships.

6. **B** - Yellow icons in the timeline indicate broken references or errors that need to be fixed.

7. **C** - Broken references occur when referenced geometry is deleted or moved, breaking the connection.

8. **C** - You should start with the leftmost error in the timeline when fixing multiple broken references.

9. **B** - The correct order is to work backwards in time but forwards in sequence through the timeline.

10. **C** - The "Edit Sketch" command is used to fix broken sketch references.

11. **D** - When you delete a broken reference, the error disappears from the timeline.

12. **B** - You use "Create > Project" to create a new reference for moved or relocated features.

13. **C** - A "Missing Profile" error occurs when an extrude feature loses its referenced profile.

14. **D** - You fix a missing profile error by clicking on the new profile to replace the missing one.

15. **D** - Chapter 2 focuses on 3D printed part design and understanding references in CAD assemblies.
