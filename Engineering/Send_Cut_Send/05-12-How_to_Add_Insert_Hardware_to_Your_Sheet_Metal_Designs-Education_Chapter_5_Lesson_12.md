## Insert Hardware Overview

### Introduction
- Alternative to threads for connecting multiple bodies in sheet metal assemblies
- Addresses limitations of threads in thin materials
- Threads can strip out when there are too few threads (2-3 threads)
- Insert hardware provides mechanical bond through crimping

### Why Use Insert Hardware
- Great way to put threads into thin material
- Requires less tooling on assembly
- No need for secondary wrench to hold nut, standoff, or stud
- Makes assemblies faster and easier during manufacturing
- Reduces assembly time (DFM benefit)
- Increases capabilities for different three-dimensional shapes
- Standoffs allow spacing components off the bottom of parts

### Main Types of Insert Hardware
- Studs: Threaded body like a bolt, crimped through the part
- Nuts: Crimped nut on the back side, increases thread count
- Standoffs: Allow spacing components up off the bottom, come in multiple thread shapes and sizes (e.g., 6-32 or 10-32 ID)

### Materials
- Standard materials: stainless steel and zinc-coated steel
- Stainless steel used with stainless steel parts
- Zinc-coated steel used with aluminum and other steel options
- Zinc can react improperly with stainless steel
- Food grade applications require matching materials (stainless steel hardware with stainless steel parts)

### Pull Direction
- Critical because hardware is crimped in
- Pulling in wrong direction causes hardware to fail
- Stud: pressed through material, pull direction must be through the part (mating part pulled up)
- Nut: pressed through, pull direction maintains same pressed direction
- Standoffs: pressed up through part, can be bolted on top, but improper use can cause issues

### Manufacturing Process
- Done through press process using two anvils (upper and lower)
- One anvil holds hardware, other pushes material into hardware
- Requires access from both top and bottom
- Machine wraps around part with limited throat depth
- Throat depth dictates how far into part PEM hardware can be installed
- Limited by max part size and minimum part size (must be able to hold part in machine)

### Spacing and Clearance Requirements
- Must have clearance from other features
- Spacing of anvils changes depending on hardware type
- Minimum spacing between hardware and other features is critical
- Features too close will fail DFM or cause deformation
- Minimum distance to bends, dimple dies, and other hardware is critical
- Acute bends prevent top anvil access, making manufacturing impossible
- Hardware cannot be installed before bending because it interferes with punch and dies

### Design Considerations
- Warping can occur due to pressure and deformation
- Excessive hardware on thin material causes warping
- Warping can be straightened out using bends to add backbone
- Excessive stress leads to warping

### Finishing
- Finishing can be done before or after depending on type
- Powder coating: hardware inserted first, then powder coating with thread protection (plugs and caps)
- Anodizing: hardware inserted after anodizing process (dip process with chemical change)
- Hardware after anodizing, before powder coating

### CAD Implementation
- Create holes in design (SendCutSend will resize them)
- Use hole feature in CAD software
- Select hardware type (nuts, studs, standoffs) on SendCutSend website
- Choose thread size (e.g., 10-32)
- Select up or down direction for pull direction
- Ensure proper hole spacing from edges

### Terms
- Insert Hardware - A mechanical fastening solution that is crimped into sheet metal to provide threads, eliminating the need for threading thin materials directly.

- Press-in Hardware - Another term for insert hardware, referring to the pressing/crimping installation process.
- Stud - A type of insert hardware that is a threaded body like a bolt, crimped through the part.
- Nut - A type of insert hardware that is a crimped nut on the back side, increasing the amount of threads in that area.
- Standoff - A type of insert hardware that allows spacing components up off the bottom of a part, available in multiple thread shapes and sizes.
- Crimping - The process of mechanically bonding insert hardware to sheet metal by deforming the material around the hardware.
- Mechanical Bond - The connection created between insert hardware and sheet metal through crimping, where teeth bite into the material.
- Pull Direction - The direction in which force should be applied to insert hardware for optimal performance, matching the press direction.
- Throat - The depth measurement on the press machine that dictates how far into a part PEM hardware can be installed.
- Anvil - One of two press components (upper and lower) used in the insert hardware installation process, where one holds the hardware and the other pushes material into it.
- Stripping Out - The failure that occurs when threads pull through material when a bolt applies pressure, typically when there are too few threads (2-3).
- Thread Protection - Plugs and caps used to cover threads during powder coating to prevent coating from entering threads.
- DFM (Design for Manufacturing) - Design principles that consider manufacturing constraints to reduce assembly time, costs, and improve efficiency.
