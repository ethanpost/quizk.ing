### Introduction to Gears
- Gears are often hidden inside gearboxes and geared motors
- Motors spin too fast (thousands of RPM) for most applications
- Gearboxes reduce speed and increase torque/power
- Gears can be enclosed (clean, greased, long-lasting) or exposed (for visual effect)

### Gear Ratios
- Basic principle: teeth of one gear mesh with teeth of another gear
- Small gear meshing with large gear creates speed reduction
- Example: 16-tooth gear meshing with 120-tooth gear = 7.5:1 ratio
- Speed reduction inversely proportional to torque increase
- 7.5:1 speed reduction = 7.5x torque increase
- Electronic speed controls cannot easily achieve such torque increases at low speeds

### Tooth Size and Shape
- Involute gears: contact points roll over each other without sliding
- Teeth constantly change contact points as they mesh
- Rolling contact vs. sliding contact
- Mod system for sizing gears (1 mod, 2 mod, 0.5 mod)
- Pitch diameter = center of mesh point
- Shaft spacing = half of each gear's pitch diameter added together
- Gears work across enormous range of scales (MEMS gears to massive industrial gears)

### Buying Gears
- Model shop gears: cheapest for small loads
- Meccano gears: no longer made but available on eBay
- Online suppliers: prices vary enormously
- Common sizes usually cheap, exotic sizes expensive
- Materials: plastic, steel, stainless steel, brass, phosphor bronze
- Phosphor bronze: most expensive, best wear resistance, good for worm gears
- Gears available with or without boss (mounting lump)

### Using Gears
- Boss useful for fixing gear to shaft
- Traditional method: keyway and key system
- Modern method: grub screw (requires drilling and tapping)
- Flat spot on shaft helps grub screw grip and prevents damage
- Plastic gears: can use oversized shaft, force fit
- Knurled shafts: industrial method for strong grip
- High-strength Loctite: for tiny pulleys on small motors
- Shaft spacing critical: too close = grinding, too loose = backlash

### Backlash
- Small wobble in gear meshing
- Not problematic for many applications
- Can be amplified in complex mechanisms
- Anti-backlash gears: two concentric gears with springs
- Springs force teeth to line up on adjacent teeth
- Prevents backlash by pushing against sides of meshing teeth

### Making Gears
- Industrial method: hobbing (similar to screw thread cutting)
- Hobby methods: taps in mill, angle grinder, CNC plasma cutter
- Wooden gears: watermills, windmills (not precise but functional)
- Modern methods: CAD programs, laser cutters for precision
- Gear generator programs can create complete CAD files

### Types of Gears
- Spur gears: most common, straight teeth
- Pin gears: historically important, used in clocks and automata
- Rack gears: straight gears for linear motion
- Worm gears: simple (bolt + gear wheel) or complex (custom-made)
- Worm gear advantages: dramatic speed reduction, self-locking
- Planetary gears: ring gear with internal teeth + spur gear arrangement
- Bevel gears: change direction by 90 degrees
- Helical gears: angled teeth for smoother operation
- Differential gears: allow wheels to turn at different speeds

### Advanced Gear Applications
- Worm gears: 24:1 reduction in compact space
- Planetary gears: can be stacked for multiple reductions
- Battery drills: all have epicyclic gearboxes
- Wind turbines: complex gearboxes under heavy loads
- Differential gears: used in cars, mechanical computers, WWII battleships
- Non-circular gears: completely extraordinary shapes that still mesh

### Terms

- Grub screw - A small screw used to fix gears to shafts
- Backlash - Small wobble or play in gear meshing
- Spur gears - The most common type of gears with straight teeth
