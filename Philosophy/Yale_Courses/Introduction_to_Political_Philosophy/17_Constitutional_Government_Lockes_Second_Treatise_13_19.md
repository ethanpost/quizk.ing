## Executive Power in Locke's Theory of Government

### Legislative Supremacy
- Locke endorses limited, constitutional government
- Emphasizes separation of powers ("subordination of powers")
- Affirms primacy of legislative authority
- First fundamental law is establishing legislative power
- Emphasis on "settled or known laws" against arbitrary rule
- Purpose of government is preventing tyrannical/despotic power

### Executive Power
- Often treated as an agent of the legislature ("ministerial and subordinate")
- Yet has distinctive role in matters of war and peace
- Federative power cannot be bound by "antecedent standing positive laws"
- Must be managed according to "prudence and wisdom" for public good
- Requires latitude beyond legislative control
- Sometimes needs "god-like princes" with extraordinary powers

### Prerogative Power
- Executive's discretionary power to act for public good "without prescription of law"
- Necessary because law cannot foresee all contingencies
- Example: demolishing innocent person's house to stop fire spread
- Similar to modern concept of eminent domain
- Raises constitutional questions about limits of executive authority
- Potential for abuse raises question: "who shall judge?"

### Appeal to Heaven
- In constitutional crises, "there shall be no judge on earth"
- People must "appeal to Heaven" - meaning right to revolution
- The people will be judge when social trust dissolves
- Affirms right to rebellion and creation of new social covenant
- Locke attempts to balance law with necessary prerogative

## Locke and America

### Lockean Influence on American Government
- Locke's principles fundamental to American founding documents
- Concepts of natural law, rights, consent, and revolution are cornerstones
- America represents prolonged experiment in Lockean principles

### Critiques of American Lockeanism
- Louis Hartz's criticism of "irrational Lockeanism" blocking alternatives
- Critics see Locke legitimizing "possessive individualism"
- Communitarian critics argue Locke's rights-focus lacks language for common good
- Locke's influence creates tensions in American political thought

### Contrasting Locke and Rawls
- Locke: Rights derive from self-ownership - "every man has property in his own person"
- Rawls: Natural endowments are arbitrary, not truly "ours"
- Locke supports meritocracy/equality of opportunity
- Rawls sees talents as "common assets" for collective distribution
- Locke emphasizes liberty; Rawls emphasizes equality
- These represent two competing visions of liberalism

### Limitations of Lockeanism
- Cannot fully satisfy deeper human longings (honor, nobility, sacrifice)
- Focus on property and comfort produces forms of Epicureanism
- America experiences the "comprehensive self-dissatisfaction" of modernity
- Return to Lockeanism not a cure for modern pathologies

## Terms
- Federative Power - Locke's term for government's power to deal with foreign affairs and war
- Prerogative Power - Executive's discretionary power to act without legal prescription for public good
- Appeal to Heaven - Locke's term for the people's right to revolution when government betrays trust
- Parliamentary Supremacy - Doctrine that legislative authority is the highest power in government
- Eminent Domain - Government power to take private property for public use with compensation
- Difference Principle - Rawls' theory that treats natural talents as common assets to benefit least advantaged
- Self-Ownership - Locke's concept that each person has exclusive property in their own person
- Possessive Individualism - Critical term for Locke's focus on property and market relations
- Original Condition - Rawls' thought experiment where people choose principles without knowing their place in society
- Constitutional State - Government limited by fundamental laws protecting rights
