> Import this file into [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/) or give it to your favorite AI tool and have it proxy a quiz and check your answers. When importing make sure you select Markdown as the format, "Multiple cards per .md file", and a ```triple backslash``` as the string delimiter. You can use the link to the raw file in GitHub instead of downloading and importing if you prefer.

### Course Structure and Workflow
- Weekly cycle: introduction of topic, assignment, lab sessions, global help time
- Open time on Saturdays with team (Adrien, Pablo, Rico)
- Regional help times throughout the week
- Weekly presentations with random student selections for review
- Three simultaneous processes each week: introducing topics, teaching basic skills, directing deeper learning

### Documentation
- Purpose of documentation:
  - Evaluation of work
  - Portfolio for future applications
  - Learning tool
  - Resource for future generations
- Quality documentation should be sufficient to reproduce work
- Documentation must be done daily, not just before class

### Version Control with Git
- Functions of Git:
  - Managing history with snapshots
  - Branching and merging for collaboration
  - Pushing and pulling between local computer and server
- Repository serves as website, file system, and history
- Editing options: web interface, local editing with GUI, terminal commands
- Authentication using cryptographic keys

### Web Development
- Starting with a template website
- Options for viewing: server viewing or local web servers
- Web development tools:
  - Editors: VI, Atom, VS Code, Sublime
  - WYSIWYG editors: Libre Office, Dreamweaver
  - Markdown vs HTML
  - Content Management Systems

### Project Management Principles
- 80/20 principle: 80% of work takes 20% of time, 20% of work takes 80% of time
- Supply-side time management: dividing available time into scheduled tasks
- Triage: deciding what to prioritize, abandon, or defer
- Serial vs parallel development
- Spiral development: iterative cycles with working versions at each stage
- Hierarchy and modularity in project development

### File Management
- All content goes in repository for evaluation
- Space considerations: megabytes per week, avoiding large files
- Avoiding spaces and non-ASCII characters in file paths
- Compression of media for responsive sites

### Terms
- Repository - A storage location containing files, history, and version information
- Git - Version control system created by Linus Torvalds for tracking changes in source code
- HTML - HyperText Markup Language, the standard markup language for web pages
- Markdown - Lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax
- WYSIWYG - "What You See Is What You Get," an editing interface showing content as it will appear
- CI/CD - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, automation for software development
- Spiral Development - Iterative development approach with working versions at each stage
- Triage - Process of prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance
- Supply-side Time Management - Allocating available time to tasks rather than fitting tasks into time
- Branching - Creating separate development paths in version control
- Merging - Combining changes from different branches in version control
- Pull/Push - Commands for transferring repository data between local and remote locations
