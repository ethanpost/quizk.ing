## Overview

### Introduction
- Justification is a major difference between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism
- Theological complexity requires broad overview
- Debates often center on role of faith but gloss over foundational differences
- Key differences: mechanism of justification and merit

### Reformed View of Justification
- Justification is forensic (legal) - counted as righteous
- Accomplished through union with Christ by faith in the power of the Spirit
- Works remain imperfect even after being born again
- Hope is outside of us in Jesus and his death, burial, and resurrection
- Through mystical union with Christ, his righteousness is imputed to us
- When God looks at us, he sees Christ
- Blessings for good deeds in heaven are purely gracious gifts, not truly merited

### Roman Catholic View of Justification
- Justification is fundamentally transformative, not forensic
- "Justify" means "to make righteous"
- Important distinction: initial justification and final justification
- Initial justification: supernatural sanctifying and renewal of inner man
- Makes someone inherently righteous and adopted as child of God
- Accomplished by baptism
- Unregenerate man cannot truly merit eternal life or rewards
- After baptism, believer by sanctifying grace is righteous and able to truly merit eternal life by works
- Without virtue of Christ, works couldn't be meritorious
- Believer's righteousness is infused by merit of Christ, especially through sacraments
- Man's good works and righteousness merit eternal life on judgment day
- Both agree salvation is by grace alone, but standing before God is very different

### Historical Context at Council of Trent
- Council of Trent did not present only a single view of justification
- Most heated and drawn out discussions in entire council
- Different medieval schools: Thomists, Scotists, and Nominalists
- Had different understandings of true merit (condign merit) related to will and justice of God
- Augustinian order with Cardinal Serapion argued for imputation of Christ's righteousness
- Augustinians pointed to insufficiency of our own works and language of Paul
- Augustinians lost the battle
- Views of imputation or belief that works cannot be truly meritorious were anathematized
- Exact meaning of true merit was left undefined (major ambiguity)

### Roman Justification - Transformative Understanding
- Latin Vulgate reflected transformative understanding
- Latin term literally means "to make just" (different from judicial sense of original Greek)
- Latin fathers (Jerome, Augustine) and medievals followed this misleading sense
- Trent didn't invent this understanding
- Theology of merit was fully developed during high middle ages, laying groundwork for Trent
- Justification is translation from condition as son of first Adam into state of grace and adoption through second Adam, Jesus Christ
- Negative side: true eradication of sin
- Positive side: supernatural sanctifying and renewal of inner man
- Produces state of grace in which Christians possess inherent justice
- Trent rejected idea that concupiscence (remaining evil inclination) was inherently sinful
- Only if concupiscence not viewed as sin could justification claim to have truly eradicated sin
- If deeds from evil will were inherently sinful, couldn't speak of deeds as truly meritorious
- All intertwined with sacramental vision of salvation
- State of grace initiated by baptism
- Restored after mortal sin by sacrament of reconciliation (confession and penance)
- Must persevere to end of life, fed and sustained by Eucharist
- Through Eucharist, get infusions of grace that enable good works
- Good works allow believer to justly merit increases of heavenly glory and eternal life

### Reformed Justification - Forensic Understanding
- Reformed affirm true Christians increase in righteousness by God's grace
- Affirm we will receive blessings for good deeds in heaven
- But language of growth and holiness isn't meaning of justification in biblical sense
- Language of justification is first and foremost legal metaphor (vindication in court, not moral transformation)
- Rome collapses regeneration (new birth) and sanctification (growth in holiness) into justification
- Vulgate translation is incorrect, failing to communicate forensic aspect of original Greek
- Unfortunate translation error with significant consequences
- Distinctions between regeneration, sanctification, and justification are crucial
- Protestants pay close attention to original Pauline sense of terms
- Justification: counting or reckoning righteous
- Act of grace in which God forgives sinful individuals and counts them as righteous on basis of faith in Christ
- Westminster Confession: justification is primarily pardon of sin and being accounted as righteous
- Based on Christ's obedience and satisfaction being imputed unto believers
- Living faith rests on Christ and receives redemption as unmerited gift
- Paul: "to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness"

### Role of Faith in Justification
- Greek term pistis used in multiple ways in New Testament
- Living faith (Paul's preferred usage)
- Dead faith (James' preferred usage)
- Westminster Confession: faith receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness is the alone instrument of justification
- Faith is not alone in person justified, but ever accompanied with all other saving graces
- Faith is no dead faith, but worketh by love
- Saving faith is living faith that works through love and is sole instrument of justification
- Reformed theologians subdivide saving faith into three parts:
  - Notia: content of revelation, promises of God in Christ
  - Assensus: assent to truth of these things as historical fact
  - Fiducia: loving trust, which apprehends promises of God in Christ
- Paul normally uses term "faith" and John often uses "belief" to refer to loving, trusting faith
- James says demons believe and tremble - referring to mere belief, not loving trust
- Demons don't have loving, trusting faith in redemption of Christ

### Catholic View of Faith
- Domingo Soto (famous Tridentine Thomist) asserted substance of faith is persuasion and assent of intellect
- Proper object is truth revealed by God
- Annoyed by Protestant definitions that smuggled in hope and love
- According to Thomas Aquinas and Trent: intellectual assent is what makes up substance of faith
- Hope and love are supernatural habits that are necessary and distinct
- Trent: faith, unless hope and charity be added, neither unites man perfectly with Christ nor makes him living member of his body
- Roman theologians speak of fides caritate formata (faith formed by love)
- Aquinas could say Abraham was initially justified by faith alone, but by formed faith alone
- Very similar to Westminster's reference to living faith, though slightly different
- Since Reformation, Roman Catholics have avoided language of "faith alone"

### Who's Right? - Core Differences
- Mere words "faith alone" are not heart of issue when people are careful with language
- Both can speak of how justification depends on union with Christ and his righteousness
- Core differences: nature of justification and whether what merits eternal life is extrinsic or intrinsic
- Can we stand before God because we successfully remain righteous by sanctifying grace?
- Or is righteousness of Christ being reckoned to us given our union with him by the Spirit?

### Scriptural Arguments
- Augustinians at Trent argued we have great reason to doubt sum total of our works measure up to divine justice
- Apostle Paul says in Philippians 3 he is not already perfect
- Paul: "For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is in my flesh"
- Paul: "I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out"
- Psalmist: "If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?"
- If Paul doesn't have ability to carry out knowledge of law, what hope do we have?
- Our sin is more serious than any of us know
- None of us could stand before God and say we merit eternal life as matter of justice
- James: "For whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all"
- Roman distinction of mortal and venial sins fails here
- We are guilty sinners before God, given we fail to fully keep law perfectly
- If reconciliation depends on ability to keep law (to perfectly love God and neighbor), we would be driven to despair
- Trent says just man can fulfill law in all its demands
- Scriptures, good reason, and experience say no
- Law: love God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength and love neighbor as ourselves
- Insofar as we serve God out of fear of hell (perfect love casts out fear) or fail to properly serve neighbor with perfect love, we have failed to keep law
- Could you have confidence you could stand before God based on righteousness in your own person?
- Huber Jedin (historian of Council of Trent) describes Augustinians' argument
- Question: on what can a man rely when he thinks of God's judgment in order not to fall into despair?
- Answer: not on any contribution in which man participates, but on Christ and his justice
- Council of Trent declared that position to be anathema

### Trent's Treatment of Paul's Vocabulary
- Trent chooses to speak of faith and works in way alien to scriptures
- More concerned with Aristotelian causes than following scripture's example
- When Paul speaks of works, it's not simply of Jewish ceremonial law
- When Paul speaks of justification, it is fundamentally forensic
- Paul speaks of faith as instrument of our justification, relying on Christ's righteousness, not righteousness of our own
- Paul in Philippians: "For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him. Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith"
- In Ephesians: in virtue of union with Christ, we have been raised and seated in heavenly places
- His righteous actions are imputed to us
- "By grace you have been saved and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus"
- In Galatians: Paul emphatically asserts we are justified by faith, not works of the law
- Not justified by successfully loving God and neighbor perfectly, but by being in Christ
- "Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ"
- "By works of the law no one will be justified"
- Language of union with Christ comes up again and again in Paul's writings
- Roman Catholic doctrine, especially Trent, fails to appreciate full implications of this
- Even in this life, we can be said to be risen in Christ, seated in heavenly places in Christ, and indeed righteous in Christ
- Picture painted: assurance grounded only in our faith in Christ's work before and after we have turned to him
- Not a sacramental treadmill that allows us to merit eternal life based on any righteousness found in us

### Terms
- Justification - In Reformed view: forensic act of being counted as righteous through union with Christ by faith. In Roman Catholic view: transformative process of being made righteous.
- Forensic - Relating to legal or judicial proceedings; in theology, refers to being declared righteous in a legal sense.
- Imputation - The act of attributing or crediting something to someone; in Reformed theology, Christ's righteousness is imputed to believers.
- Merit - Something that deserves reward or punishment. Reformed view: our works cannot truly merit eternal life. Roman Catholic view: after baptism, believers can truly merit eternal life by their works.
