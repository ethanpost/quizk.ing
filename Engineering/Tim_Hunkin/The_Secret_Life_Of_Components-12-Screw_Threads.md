## Master Answer Key

**C** - Tap: A tap is specifically designed to cut internal threads in holes, with flutes cut out to allow chip removal.

**B** - Better alignment at right angles: The pillar drill provides better control and alignment compared to a battery drill, which is harder to keep perpendicular.

**D** - 5mm: For a 6mm thread, you need to drill a 5mm hole first to allow the tap to cut the thread properly.

**B** - Yellow: Yellow rings indicate high-quality taps that are sharper and last much longer than cheaper alternatives.

**C** - Drilling slightly larger holes than recommended: For fragile 2mm taps, drilling 1.7mm holes instead of 1.6mm reduces stress and prevents breaking.

**B** - Better alignment and control: The lathe provides precise alignment and control that's difficult to achieve with hand tools.

**C** - Lead screw: The lead screw moves the tool post along the lathe bed at the correct rate to create threads.

**D** - Pressing threads into the metal: Thread rolling uses pressure from rolling plates to form threads rather than cutting them.

**B** - They all involve an existing screw thread: Every thread making method requires an existing thread as a reference or template.

**C** - Joseph Whitworth: Joseph Whitworth standardized thread systems in Britain, creating the famous Whitworth standard.

**B** - Whitworth: The original Whitworth thread is still used on camera tripod mounts, showing its lasting impact.

**B** - Thread pitch: The main difference is the distance between threads - coarse threads have wider spacing than fine threads.

**C** - They cut into the bolt less: Fine threads have more contact area and cut less deeply into the bolt material.

**C** - Stamping process: Bolt heads are formed by stamping metal blanks, not by machining from solid bar.

**D** - They are softer and more sticky: Stainless steel is softer than mild steel and tends to gall or stick more easily.

**B** - Spring washers: Spring washers dig into the metal surfaces to prevent vibration from loosening the connection.

**C** - Nylock nut: Nylock nuts have a nylon ring that grips the thread to prevent loosening from vibration.

**C** - It prevents vibration loosening: Loctite is a thread locking compound that prevents bolts from working loose.

**D** - Alignment marks: Telltale indicators are alignment marks that show if bolts have moved from their original position.

**B** - They only contact at the root of the head: Wrong angles mean the bolt head only touches at the bottom edge, reducing strength.

**C** - Choosing the countersink bit closest to bolt head diameter: This ensures the countersink matches the bolt head size perfectly.

**C** - Thin metal where threads strip easily: Clinch nuts are designed for thin metal applications where regular threads would strip.

**D** - Drill out the hole larger: The first step is enlarging the damaged hole before inserting the repair system.

**B** - 15th century: Wood screws were hand-filed since the 15th century for high-quality furniture.

**C** - Mr. Nettlefold: Mr. Nettlefold started mass production of wood screws in Britain in 1819.

**B** - They can drive into wood without pilot holes: Modern wood screws have features that allow them to self-drill into wood.

**D** - Self-tapping screw: These screws combine features of wood screws and bolts, cutting their own threads.

**C** - 30 degrees: Self-tapping screws have a shallow 30-degree thread angle for easier cutting.

**C** - Square threads: Castle threads have a square profile, also called acme threads.

**B** - They can transmit a lot of force: The square profile allows for high force transmission without stripping.

**B** - 0.001mm: Micrometer threads are accurate to one thousandth of a millimeter.

**C** - Ball screw: Ball screws are the precision version of acme threads, using ball bearings for smooth motion.

**B** - Ball bearings: Ball bearings run in circular tracks inside the nut for smooth, precise motion.

**D** - Podger: A podger is an alignment tool used to line up bolt holes in construction work.

**B** - Bolted joints first, then welded joints: This ensures proper alignment before permanent welding.

**C** - Use mole grips: Mole grips can grip damaged bolt heads to provide turning force.

**C** - Angle grinder: An angle grinder can reshape damaged heads back to flat heads for screwdriver use.

**B** - It provides heat to loosen the bolt: Welding provides both a connection point and heat that can help loosen rusted bolts.
