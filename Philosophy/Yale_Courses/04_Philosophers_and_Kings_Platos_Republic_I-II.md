### Introduction to the Republic
- Republic is the book that "started it all" in political science
- Every political book since is a response to Plato
- First five books deal with the best city (Kallipolis)
- Complex and perplexing work requiring proper approach

### What is the Republic About?
- Multiple interpretations: justice, moral psychology, power of poetry/myth, metaphysics
- Should be approached as a dialogue/conversation, not a treatise
- Work of literature comparable to masterworks like Hamlet or War and Peace
- Readers are invited to be active participants in the dialogue

### The Republic as Utopia
- Presents an extreme vision of politics
- Based on correspondence between parts of city and parts of soul
- Harmony between individual and society is the goal
- Famous formula: philosophers must become kings

### Educational Purpose
- Not a totalitarian blueprint as Karl Popper suggested
- Republic is a tutelary association focused on education
- Plato founded the Academy, the first university
- Modern universities like Yale are direct descendants of Plato's Academy

### Historical Context
- Plato born in 427 BCE during Peloponnesian War
- Witnessed Athens' defeat and execution of Socrates
- Established the Academy after traveling throughout Greek world
- Republic reflects his disillusionment with politics after these experiences

### Structure and Setting
- Opens with "I went down to the Piraeus" (catabasis - a descent)
- Set around 411 BCE during Peace of Nicias
- Begins with Socrates and Glaucon at the Piraeus harbor
- They are invited/compelled to join Polemarchus at his father's house

### Characters and Their Symbolic Roles
- Cephalus: represents appetitive part of soul, concerned with wealth
- Polemarchus: represents spirited part, concerned with honor
- Thrasymachus: represents rational part, though in corrupted form
- Glaucon and Adeimantus: Plato's brothers, continue dialogue after Book I
- Each character represents different classes that will later appear in Kallipolis

### Beginning of the Dialogue
- Confrontation between force (Polemarchus) and persuasion (Socrates)
- Question of who has title to rule: majority or philosophers
- Can democracy be compatible with philosophy?
- Socrates challenges Cephalus's conventional view of justice
- Socrates dismisses tradition (Cephalus) from the dialogue

### Terms
- Kallipolis - The beautiful city or just city described by Socrates in the Republic
- Catabasis - A descent or going down, referring to Socrates' journey to the Piraeus
- Polis - The Greek city-state, the primary political unit in ancient Greece
- Republic (Politeia) - The Greek title means "regime" or "constitution" 
- Academy - Plato's school in Athens, considered the first university
- Utopia - An ideal society or community (term coined later by Thomas More)
- Philosopher-Kings - Plato's solution for just governance: rulers who are philosophers
- Appetitive part - Element of the soul concerned with desires and acquisition
- Spirited part - Element of the soul concerned with honor, loyalty and courage
- Rational part - Element of the soul concerned with reason and wisdom
