## What is Tradition Overview

### Fundamental Positions on Scripture and Tradition
- The debate is not about whether authoritative tradition exists
- Historic Protestants would affirm the Council of Nicaea as an authority
- Both Catholics and Protestants affirm scripture is uniquely God-breathed and perfect
- The real fight is over whether uncorrupted apostolic traditions exist outside of scripture but equally authoritative
- The fight is also over whether there is a church body inherently guided by God in discerning these traditions

### Roman Catholic View of Tradition
- Multiple senses of the term tradition exist
- First sense: broad tradition containing divine revelations equal to scripture
- Word of God is both written and oral, with oral teachings documented later
- Sacred tradition and sacred scripture form one sacred deposit of the word of God
- Both are to be treated equally as parts of the word of God
- Council of Trent invoked apostolic tradition to justify various liturgical practices
- Different kinds of ecclesiastical traditions aren't to be treated as apostolic
- Council of Trent declares adherence to doctrine of holy scriptures, apostolic traditions, and consent of councils and fathers
- Roman church possesses sole responsibility to judge the true sense and interpretation of holy scriptures

### The Magisterium
- Teaching office of pope or bishops and councils in union with the pope
- Large percentage of tradition is made up of past magisterial documents
- Ordinary magisterium: ordinary teaching duties of popes and bishops (e.g., Augustine's sermons)
- Extraordinary magisterium: solemn teaching of councils and popes often considered infallible
- Writings of saints and theologians carry varying weight (Aquinas or prominent church fathers hold more weight)
- None of the writings of saints and theologians are infallible
- Universal ordinary magisterium: taught by everyone everywhere in general consensus, often thought to be infallible
- Magisterium is the authoritative interpreter of the word of God
- Tradition encompasses divine revelation and various gradations of past magisterial teaching

### Reformed View
- Church has no extraordinary magisterium that can be infallible
- Word of God preserved by the Holy Spirit in the church is both written and unwritten
- Holy scriptures are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus
- Reformed tradition affirms material sufficiency of scripture regarding the gospel
- Westminster Confession: things necessary for salvation are clearly propounded in scripture
- In absence of infallible magisterial judgments, scripture is the sole infallible rule of faith
- Probably a few apostolic traditions outside of scripture, but none that can be known for certain
- Church has central role: Christ has given ministry, oracles, and ordinances of God
- God has given promises to his church, and by his spirit accomplishes what he has promised
- Word of God is living and active in his church (vivox evangeli - living voice of the gospel)
- Second Helvetic Confession: preaching of the word of God is the word of God
- Spirit-empowered teaching of God's word through his church is a living tradition with authority
- This tradition does not include and never can include anything outside of scripture
- Examples of things not included: Mary's assumption, perpetual virginity, sinlessness, apostolic succession, Petrine primacy
- As long as preaching is faithful to the word of God and spirit-empowered, it should be treated as authoritative
- This is closer to how terms tradition or rule of faith were used in earliest fathers like Irenaeus

### Problems with Roman Magisterium
- God gave no promise to the church in scriptures that we will have infallibility in ecclesiastical institutions
- Promise that gates of hell will not prevail is about ultimate victory, not magisterial infallibility
- It is an ecclesiology of presumption
- Goalposts have been moved significantly over time
- Official theology of the church has regularly changed on the topic
- Much magisterial teaching with authority comparable to scripture is simply ignored when it becomes embarrassing
- Counterreformation and medieval theology had higher respect for legislative and disciplinary decisions
- Currently no limit on pope's authority to prevent mass ethnic or national excommunication (interdicts)
- Interdicts used to control kings and governments by shutting down access to sacraments and Christian burial
- For Suarez, settled canon law of the church could not be in moral error
- Suarez and Bellarmine thought canon law and papal legislation were generally morally impeccable
- Pius IV in 1794 bull condemned the idea that the church could have established dangerous and harmful discipline
- View of legislative infallibility existed at time of counterreformation and beyond
- This view was partly fueled by forgeries
- Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals were included in Gratian's Decretum, most influential collection of canon law for hundreds of years
- These forgeries directly affected development of Catholic theology
- When papal infallibility was declared in 1870, there was significant disagreement how far this would extend
- Ambiguity around status of legislative decisions and even teachings on faith and morals
- Vast majority of observant Catholics recognize that highest levels of papal and conciliar legislation have had moral failings

### Historical Examples of Magisterial Failures
- Lateran 3 (1179): decreed Christian servants living in homes of Jewish or Muslim masters should be excommunicated
- Lateran 3: evidence of Christians accepted against Jews in every case
- Lateran 3: Jews ought to be subject to Christians
- Lateran 4: mandated Christian princes force Jews to wear distinguishing clothes
- Lateran 4: Jews couldn't go outside during Holy Week
- Lateran 4: Jews couldn't hold public office
- Lateran 4: Jewish converts to Christianity must leave behind all traditional Jewish practices
- Lateran 3: instigated genocide of heretical groups like Cathars, promising indulgences to all who fought against them
- Lateran 3: goods of heretics to be confiscated and princes free to subject them to slavery
- Lateran 4: mandated expulsion of heretics from their homes
- Lateran 4: threatened to excommunicate and depose noblemen who refused
- Implicit view that pope can revoke government legitimacy at will
- Benedict XIV's Vix Pervenit (1745): usury is any interest on a loan written into contract
- By original intent, this condemns entire modern banking and financial system
- Modern Roman church ignores strict meaning of past magisterial documents when convenient
- Nicholas IV (1452): formally sanctioned perpetual slavery of unbelieving peoples
- Nicholas IV granted permission to invade, search out, capture and subjugate Saracens and pagans
- This created incentive to prevent conversion of African peoples
- Pope Alexander VI: granted Spanish crown perpetual title to most of Americas
- This extreme claim to secular power was in tradition of papal hierocracy
- Pope Boniface VIII in Unam Sanctam: temporal governments wield sword entirely at will and sufferance of pope
- Pope Boniface VIII in Unam Sanctam: absolutely necessary for salvation of every human creature to be subject to Roman pontiff
- Pope Clement VI in Super Quibusdam: no man outside faith of church and outside obedience to pope of Rome can finally be saved
- Pope Eugene IV in Cantate Domino (Council of Florence): those not living within Catholic Church cannot become participants in eternal life
- Cantate Domino specifically aimed at Coptic Church
- Recently Vatican canonized Copts who were martyred by ISIS
- Vatican declared Armenian Orthodox theologian a doctor of the church
- Contradiction between past and recent teaching

### Terms
- Tradition - For Roman Catholics, an umbrella term encompassing divine revelations equal to scripture and various gradations of past magisterial teaching. For the Reformed, the spirit-empowered teaching of God's word through his church that has authority but never includes anything outside of scripture.
- Magisterium - The teaching office of the pope or bishops and councils in union with the pope. For Rome, it is the authoritative interpreter of the word of God.
- Ordinary Magisterium - The ordinary teaching duties of popes and bishops, such as sermons and pastoral letters.
- Extraordinary Magisterium - The solemn teaching of councils and popes, often considered infallible.
- Universal Ordinary Magisterium - Something taught by everyone everywhere in general consensus, often thought to be infallible.
- Apostolic Tradition - Traditions handed down from the apostles that are on equal footing with scripture according to Roman Catholic teaching.
- Sola Scriptura - The doctrine that scripture is the sole infallible rule of faith, affirmed by the Reformed tradition.
- Material Sufficiency of Scripture - The belief that all things necessary for salvation are clearly propounded in scripture, affirmed by the Reformed tradition.
- Vivox Evangeli - The living voice of the gospel, what Luther called the word of God as living and active in his church.
- Rule of Faith - For early fathers like Irenaeus, this meant the contents of the Apostles Creed, not a massive store of information equal to scripture.
- Interdict - A mass ethnic or national excommunication that shuts down access to sacraments and Christian burial, used historically to control kings and governments.
- Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals - Forgeries that were included in Gratian's Decretum and directly affected the development of Catholic theology, including views on legislative infallibility.
- Papal Hierocracy - The view that temporal governments wield power entirely at the will and sufferance of the pope.
- Lateran Councils - Ecumenical councils that issued decrees regarding Jews, heretics, and church discipline, including mandates for distinguishing clothing and restrictions on Jewish activities.
- Usury - According to Benedict XIV, any interest on a loan written into the contract with the aim of gaining more money on return, which by original intent condemns the entire modern banking system.
