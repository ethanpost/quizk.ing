## [Type III Anodizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCIsL5E7Q60)

### Overview of Aluminum Finishes
- As-machined aluminum has iridescence and shine
- Conductive on outer surface
- Prone to corrosion without protection
- Anodizing is controlled oxidation of the surface

### Types of Anodizing
- Type II Anodizing
  - Used for light wear applications
  - Provides long-term corrosion resistance
  - Can be pigmented with various colors
  - Creates non-conductive surface
- Type III Anodizing (Hard Coat)
  - More durable than Type II
  - Has additional material buildup (oxidation)
  - Used in high-wear environments
  - Provides approximately 0.001" of growth on outer layer

### Type II Anodizing Characteristics
- Black Type II is most commonly selected finish at Xometry
- Creates clean cosmetic black finish
- Parts can have shine if not bead blasted before anodizing
- Matte finish requires bead blasting before anodizing
- Clear anodized is not same appearance as as-milled finish
  - May have slight yellow tint
  - More cloudiness
  - Different surface roughness
  - Less reflectivity than as-milled
  - Shows crystallization grain-like finish
- Available in multiple colors (blue, purple, red, yellow)
- Permanent pigmentation into the part

### Type III Anodizing Characteristics
- Also called hard coat anodizing
- Most commonly used in black color
- Similar appearance to Type II but with thicker oxidation layer
- Approximately 0.001" of growth on outer surface
- Used in high-wear environments
- Suitable for mechanical contact applications
  - Parts that hit other objects
  - Parts being hit themselves
  - Parts rubbing against other components
- Natural Type III finish appears brownish, not clear

### Surface Finish Considerations
- Bead blasting before anodizing creates matte finish
- As-milled anodizing retains shine
- Clear anodizing changes surface appearance
- Anodizing converts the outer surface through controlled oxidation
- Creates consistent oxidation across the part

### Terms
- Anodizing - A controlled oxidation process for metal surfaces that provides protection and allows for coloring
- Type II Anodizing - Standard anodizing process used for light wear applications with corrosion resistance and color options
- Type III Anodizing - Hard coat anodizing process that creates a thicker, more durable oxide layer for high-wear applications
- Hard Coat - Another term for Type III anodizing
- Bead Blasting - Surface preparation technique that creates a matte finish before anodizing
- As-Machined/As-Milled - The surface finish directly from CNC machining, before any finishing processes
- Clear Anodized - Anodizing without color pigment, results in slightly cloudy appearance compared to raw aluminum
- Natural Type III - Non-pigmented hard coat anodizing that has a brownish appearance
