### Historical Background of Sulfur
- Known since the dawn of humanity
- Found in volcanic regions
- Ancient name "brimstone" or "burning stone" in Old English
- Sanskrit origin "sulvere" meaning "enemy of copper"
- Latin "sulphurium" evolved to modern "sulfur"

### Physical Properties
- Yellow solid
- Burns with a blue flame
- Produces acrid, foul-smelling fumes when burned

### Volcanic Connection
- Found in volcanic regions
- Approximately 50 active volcanoes worldwide
- Releases sulfurous fumes from deep underground
- Associated with "evil things" underground due to location

### Chemical Properties
- Reacts with copper
- Transforms shiny copper into black copper sulfide
- Burns in oxygen with blue flame
- Produces sulfur dioxide when burned
- Sulfur dioxide reacts with water to form acidic solution

### Terms
- Brimstone - Old English term for sulfur, referring to the "burning stone"
- Sulvere - Sanskrit term meaning "enemy of copper"
- Copper sulfide - Black compound formed when sulfur reacts with copper
- Deflagrating spoon - Laboratory tool used for burning substances in gas jars
- Universal indicator - Chemical that changes color to indicate acidity/alkalinity
