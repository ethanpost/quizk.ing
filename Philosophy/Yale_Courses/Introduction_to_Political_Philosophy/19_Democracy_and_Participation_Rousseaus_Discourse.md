## Rousseau's Theory of Inequality

### Amour-propre vs Amour de soi-même
- Amour-propre: untranslatable French term related to pride, vanity, conceit
- Described as the first and most durable cause of inequality
- Only arises in society, not natural to humans
- "Moves each individual to value himself more than anyone else"
- Source of both evil and honor in society
- Different from Hobbes' view of pride as natural
- Developed when people began to look at one another and desire to be looked at
- Begins with preferences: who sang, danced best, was strongest, most adroit, most eloquent

### The Nature of Amour-propre
- Both negative and positive aspects
- Negative: creates vanity, contempt, shame, envy
- Positive: underlying desire for recognition and respect
- Connected to our sense of justice
- Makes us angry when our opinions are slighted
- Can become violent when manipulated
- Similar to Plato's concept of thumos (spiritedness)

### Civilization and Its Discontents
- Early primitive societies represented happiest state for humans
- Fall from happy state came with two inventions: agriculture and metallurgy
- Agriculture led to division of land and property
- Metallurgy brought the art of war and conquest
- Establishment of government merely sanctioned existing inequalities
- Social contract portrayed as a swindle by the rich to control the poor

### The Bourgeoisie
- New human type created by civilization
- Characterized by tension between seeming and being
- Lives through opinions of others
- "Only knows how to live in the opinions of others"
- Duplicitous, hypocritical, and false
- Perpetually driven by amour-propre

## Rousseau's Solutions

### Rural Democracy
- Small, isolated rural republics like Geneva
- Simple patriotism not overwhelmed by amour-propre
- Most closely approximates equality of natural man

### Return to Nature
- Return to primordial "sentiment of existence"
- Psychological return to natural state
- Only achieved by rare "aristocrats of nature"
- Based on superior sensitivity and compassion rather than wisdom
- Requires inward journey away from society

### The Social Contract
- Published in 1762, seven years after Second Discourse
- Famous opening: "Man is born free and is everywhere in chains"
- Attempts to legitimize social bonds
- Different style from Second Discourse: dry, legal language
- Presents itself as utopian while claiming to be realistic
- Basic premise: humans are born free, all hierarchy is conventional
- Seeks to preserve individual liberty without lapsing into anarchy
- Solution found in the concept of the general will

## Terms
- Amour-propre - An untranslatable French term referring to a relative, artificial sentiment born in society that moves people to value themselves more than others and is the source of both honor and social evils.
- Amour de soi-même - Natural self-love that moves every animal to be vigilant in its own preservation, which when directed by reason and modified by pity produces humanity and virtue.
- Bourgeoisie - Rousseau's term for the new type of human being brought into existence by civilization, characterized by living through the opinions of others and the necessity to appear to be one thing while being another.
- General Will - Rousseau's concept in the Social Contract that represents the collective interest of society as a whole, distinct from the particular wills of individuals.
- Social Contract - In the Second Discourse, portrayed as a swindle that legitimizes inequalities; later reframed in his book of the same name as a potential solution to the problem of preserving freedom in society.
- Thumos - Plato's concept of spiritedness, similar to Rousseau's amour-propre in being a passion that can lead to anger over perceived slights but potentially redirectable toward social goods.
