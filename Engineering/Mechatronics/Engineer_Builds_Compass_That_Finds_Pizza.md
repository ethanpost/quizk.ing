### Project Overview
- A compass that points to pizza instead of North
- Three-week engineering challenge
- Created by Joe Grand, computer engineer and hardware hacker
- Goals: build system to point to nearest pizza place, refine prototype into compact device, make operation simple

### Hardware Components
- Particle microcontroller module with cellular network interface
- GPS module to determine current location
- Magnetometer (digital compass) to measure Earth's magnetic field
- LED ring for directional indication
- Lithium-ion battery for power
- Button for user interaction
- Antenna for cellular connectivity

### Development Process
- Initial prototyping on breadboard
- Testing individual components
- Writing code to control each component
- Integrating compass functionality
- Implementing GPS and cellular connectivity
- Designing custom circuit board with artistic elements
- Manufacturing and assembly of final product

### Data Flow
- Button press sends GPS coordinates over cellular network to Particle
- Particle sends coordinates to Google Maps API
- Google returns information about nearest pizza place
- Device processes data to determine direction
- LEDs indicate direction to pizza

### Circuit Board Design and Manufacturing
- Circuit board as physical manifestation of electronic product
- Artistic elements incorporated into design
- Professional manufacturing process:
  - Raw material selection
  - Drilling
  - Resist coating
  - Laser plotting
  - Electroplating
  - Etching
  - Solder mask application
- Assembly process:
  - Solder paste application
  - Pick and place machine component placement
  - Reflow oven soldering
  - 3D x-ray inspection
