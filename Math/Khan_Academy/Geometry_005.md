### Definition and Components
- An angle is formed when two rays share a common vertex
- The common point is called the vertex of the angle
- Angles can be formed by rays, lines, or line segments
- The concept of an angle comes from the Latin word for "corner"

### Notation and Labeling
- Angles are labeled using three letters (not just the vertex)
- The vertex letter appears in the middle position
- Example: angle BAC or angle CAB (where A is the vertex)
- The symbol for angle (∠) resembles a small corner
- Using three letters clarifies which specific angle is being referenced

### Multiple Angles at Intersections
- When lines or line segments intersect, multiple angles are formed
- Simply labeling an angle with the vertex point is ambiguous
- Three-letter notation specifies exactly which angle is being discussed
- Example: At intersection H, angles EHG, DHG, FHE, and FHD are all different angles

### Angle Measurement
- Angles differ in how "open" or "closed" they are
- The measure of an angle quantifies this openness
- A more open angle has a greater measure than a more closed angle
- Angle measurement will be covered in subsequent material

### Terms
- Angle - A geometric figure formed by two rays sharing a common endpoint (vertex)
- Vertex - The common endpoint where two rays meet to form an angle
- Ray - A part of a line that starts at a point and extends infinitely in one direction
- Line segment - A part of a line with two endpoints
- Angle measure - A quantification of how "open" or "closed" an angle is
