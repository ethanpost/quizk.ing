### Introduction
- Stars form from clouds of gas and dust
- Star's mass determines its lifetime and fate
- Nuclear fusion powers stars, converting mass to energy (E=mcÂ²)
- Stars produce elements beyond hydrogen and helium

### Star Life Cycle
- Life cycle spans millions to billions of years
- Star's mass determines its evolutionary path
- Nuclear fusion creates equilibrium against gravitational collapse
- Stars begin with hydrogen fusion in their cores

### Low Mass Stars
- Range from 13 Jupiter masses to approximately Sun's mass
- Formation process
  - Gas cloud contracts under gravity
  - Core heats until nuclear fusion begins
  - Hydrogen fuses into helium through proton-proton chain
- Main sequence phase
  - Steady size, temperature, and luminosity
  - Lasts billions of years
- Red giant phase
  - Core shrinks and heats as hydrogen depletes
  - Outer layers expand and cool
  - Lasts about a billion years
- Helium flash
  - Triple-alpha process begins
  - Helium fuses into carbon and oxygen
- Horizontal branch
  - Star becomes smaller, hotter, and bluer
  - Core becomes primarily carbon and oxygen
- Asymptotic giant branch
  - Final expansion as a giant star
  - Last energy bursts eject outer layers
- Final fate: White dwarf
  - Earth-sized, hot, bare core
  - No more fuel to burn
  - Very dense (one teaspoon weighs ~15 tons)
  - Electron degeneracy pressure prevents further collapse
- Planetary nebula
  - Ejected shell of material
  - Material becomes available for new star formation

### High Mass Stars
- Much more massive than our sun
- Main sequence phase
  - Hot, big, bright, and blue
  - Burn fuel much faster (10-100 million years)
- Giant phase
  - Core contracts and heats
  - Star swells into a giant
- Advanced fusion stages
  - Helium fusion creates carbon and oxygen
  - Progressive fusion creates heavier elements
  - Elements arranged in layers by weight
  - Iron forms at the core (heaviest element fusion can produce in stars)
- Supernova
  - Iron core cannot fuse further
  - Gravity wins, causing core collapse
  - Outer layers bounce off core causing explosion
  - Ejection of heavy elements into space

### Stellar Remnants
- White dwarfs
  - Remnants of low mass stars (less than 8 solar masses)
  - Maximum mass is 1.4 solar masses (Chandrasekhar limit)
  - Electron degeneracy pressure prevents further collapse
- Neutron stars
  - Core between 1.4-3 solar masses
  - Electrons combine with protons to form neutrons
  - Extremely dense (teaspoon weighs ~10 million tons)
  - About the size of New York City
- Black holes
  - Core above 3 solar masses
  - Gravity overcomes neutron degeneracy pressure
  - Mass collapses to a point of infinite density (singularity)
  - Warps spacetime so light cannot escape

### Significance of Stellar Death
- Supernovae create elements heavier than iron
  - Nickel, copper, zinc, silver, gold, etc.
  - Heavy elements are rare compared to lighter elements
- Supernovae can outshine entire galaxies
- Stellar remnants and ejected material contribute to new generations of stars

### Terms
- Main Sequence Star - A star in the stable phase of its life, fusing hydrogen into helium in its core.
- Red Giant - An expanded, cooler phase of a star after hydrogen in the core is depleted.
- Helium Flash - The sudden ignition of helium fusion in the core of a low-mass star.
- White Dwarf - The dense, earth-sized remnant of a low-mass star supported by electron degeneracy pressure.
- Planetary Nebula - The ejected outer layers of a dying low-mass star.
- Supernova - A powerful explosion marking the death of a high-mass star.
- Neutron Star - An extremely dense stellar remnant composed almost entirely of neutrons.
- Black Hole - A region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.
- Nuclear Fusion - The process of combining atomic nuclei to form heavier nuclei, releasing energy.
- Chandrasekhar Limit - The maximum mass (1.4 solar masses) that a white dwarf can have before electron degeneracy pressure is overcome.
- Triple-Alpha Process - The nuclear fusion reaction where three helium nuclei combine to form carbon.
- Electron Degeneracy Pressure - The quantum mechanical force that prevents electrons from occupying the same energy state, supporting white dwarfs against collapse.
- Neutron Degeneracy Pressure - The force that prevents neutrons from occupying the same energy state, supporting neutron stars against collapse.
- Horizontal Branch - A phase in a low-mass star's life after the helium flash when it becomes smaller, hotter, and bluer.
- Asymptotic Giant Branch - The final giant phase of a low-mass star before it ejects its outer layers.
