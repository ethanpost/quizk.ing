### Laser Technology
- Principles: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
- Types:
  - CO2 lasers (10 microns, far infrared)
  - Fiber lasers (1 micron, efficient for metal)
  - Diode lasers (visible spectrum)
- Configuration:
  - Tube lasers (CO2): stationary laser with mirrors
  - Diode lasers: simpler as laser moves directly
  - Galvo scanners: steering mirrors for precise engraving
- Material interaction:
  - Burning, melting, evaporation, ablation
  - All release material requiring ventilation
- Air assist and exhaust importance
  - Push combustion products down
  - Extract fumes/smoke
  - Prevent deposits on optics

### Laser Safety
- Stay in vicinity of operating laser
- Class 1 lasers typically don't need eye protection
- Fire risks
  - Material can ignite if laser stops moving
  - Keep fire suppression nearby (blanket or stock piece)
  - Clean optics regularly
  - Remove scrap materials to prevent fire

### Materials for Laser Cutting
- Cardboard:
  - Best material for construction kits
  - Look for good quality (bends smoothly rather than kinks)
  - Renewable and sustainable
- Wood:
  - Thickness consistency matters
- Acrylic (Plexiglass/Perspex):
  - Can be glued with solvent adhesives
  - Can be heat-bent
  - Clear but cracks easily
- Delrin:
  - Tougher than acrylic but not clear
  - Better for structures requiring durability
- Fabric, pasta
- Materials to avoid:
  - PVC (releases chlorine)
  - Shiny metal in CO2 lasers (reflection hazard)

### Laser Wavelength Comparison
- CO2 lasers: good for wood and acrylic, can't cut metal
- Fiber lasers: shorter wavelength, can cut metal
- Diode lasers: visible spectrum, versatile for engraving

### Laser Cutting Parameters
- Focus: beam waist for narrowest cut
- Power: too little doesn't cut, too much causes fire
- Speed: too slow risks fire, too fast doesn't cut through
- Pulse frequency: affects feature spacing
- Mode: rastering vs. vector cutting
