### Color-Changing Reactions
- Universal indicator shows different colors based on acidity/alkalinity
- Red in strongly acidic conditions
- Green in neutral conditions
- Purple in strongly alkaline conditions
- Thymolphthalein is colorless in acid and blue in alkaline conditions
- Acid and alkali react to produce salt plus water
- Carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid when mixed with water

### Apparent Reversible Reactions
- Methylene blue reaction with oxygen turns colorless to blue
- Glucose slowly turns methylene blue from blue back to colorless
- Indigo carmine demonstrates similar color-changing properties
- These are not truly reversible but involve secondary reactions

### Clock Reactions
- Two-stage chemical reactions with delayed color changes
- First reaction slowly releases iodine
- Second reaction quickly absorbs iodine until reactant is depleted
- When second reactant is depleted, iodine becomes visible
- Starch makes iodine appear dark blue/black

### Changes of State in Chemical Reactions
- Nylon formation at interface of two liquids
- Silver mirror formation through chemical deposition
- Sodium acetate crystallization (chemical sculpture)
- Hand warmers use sodium acetate crystallization to produce heat
- Para nitro acetanilide and sulfuric acid reaction forms solid

### Energy in Chemical Reactions
- Hydrogen combustion releases energy (light, heat, sound)
- Phosphorus combustion in oxygen produces intense white light
- Nitric oxide and carbon disulfide reaction produces light and sound
- Most reactions move from high energy to low energy states
- Some reactions absorb energy from surroundings (endothermic)

### Fire Extinguishing Chemistry
- Water extinguishers work by cooling and removing heat
- Water can intensify fires containing magnesium and silver nitrate
- Carbon dioxide extinguishers work by excluding oxygen
- Magnesium can burn in carbon dioxide
- Dry powder extinguishers contain sodium/potassium carbonates
- Yellow powder (modified gunpowder using fire extinguisher components) is explosive

### Oscillating Reactions
- Belousov reaction shows cyclical color changes (green → blue → red → green)
- Briggs-Rauscher reaction shows similar oscillating color patterns
- Not truly reversible but cyclical due to complex reaction networks
- Chemicals are consumed over time, eventually stopping oscillations

### Entropy and Chemical Equilibrium
- Entropy is the measure of disorder in a system
- Entropy tends to increase with time
- Chemical reactions can be driven by:
  - Energy decrease (like a ball rolling downhill)
  - Entropy increase (like a teenager's bedroom becoming disordered)
- Nitrogen dioxide/dinitrogen tetroxide equilibrium demonstrates true reversibility
- Temperature affects equilibrium position

### Superconductivity
- Yttrium barium copper oxide becomes superconductor at very low temperatures
- Superconductors have zero electrical resistance
- Type II superconductors can repel and trap magnetic fields
- Demonstrated by magnetic levitation

- Clock Reaction - A reaction with a sudden color change after a delay period
- Nylon - A synthetic polymer formed at the interface of two liquids
- Endothermic Reaction - A reaction that absorbs energy from its surroundings
- Exothermic Reaction - A reaction that releases energy to its surroundings
- Entropy - A measure of disorder or randomness in a system
- Chemical Equilibrium - A state where forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates
- Oscillating Reaction - A reaction that cycles through different states or colors
- Superconductor - A material with zero electrical resistance at very low temperatures
- Combustion - A chemical reaction between a fuel and an oxidizer that produces heat and light
