### Introduction and General Characteristics
- Entered service in 1966 as a reconnaissance (spy) aircraft
- No bombs or guns; relied on altitude and speed for defense
- Sustained Mach 3.2 (2,200+ mph) at altitudes up to 85,000 feet
- Never shot down; outran missiles and hostile aircraft
- Relatively large airplane compared to other reconnaissance craft
- Two-thirds of fuselage occupied by fuel tanks

### Aerodynamics and Structure
- Delta wing design (triangular shape) optimal for supersonic flight
- Sharp, thin wing slices through air at high speeds
- Chines (sharp edges) along fuselage provide 20% of total lift at speed
- Reduced radar cross-section through design features
- Utilized early radar-absorbing composite materials
- Airframe primarily made of titanium for heat and stress performance
- Aircraft expanded several inches when traveling at speed

### J58 Jet Engines
- Standard turbojet design with compressor, combustor, and turbine sections
- Continuous full afterburner at cruising speed
- Converging/diverging nozzle converts heat and pressure into velocity
- Ejector flaps adjust based on pressure differences

### Inlet Spike System
- Adjustable spike created shock waves to tune airflow
- Supersonic air slowed to subsonic speeds before entering engine
- Bypass system rerouted excess air around engine
- Pressure recovery from inlet spike responsible for 58% of thrust at Mach 3.2
- Spike retracted up to 26 inches as speed increased to maintain shock wave alignment
- Inlet unstart could cause 70% loss of thrust

### Engine Supporting Features
- Multiple bypass doors and vents to control airflow
- Computer-controlled cowl bleed vents
- Boundary layer bleed holes maintained smooth airflow
- Start carts with two muscle-car engines used to start the engines

### Fuel System
- JP-7 specialized fuel with high ignition point (466Â°F)
- Triethylborane (TEB) chemical used to ignite JP-7 fuel
- Fuel served as lubricant, coolant, and hydraulic fluid
- Fuel tanks incorporated into wing structure without barriers
- Panels leaked fuel when cold due to expansion design
- Nitrogen used to inert fuel tanks for safety

### Flight Control Surfaces
- Dual rudders above each engine
- Elevons (combined elevator and aileron) for roll and pitch control
- Mechanical mixer in center tail section blended roll and pitch commands
- Hydraulic system translated mechanical inputs to surface movements
- Stick pusher system could automatically counteract stall conditions

### Landing Gear
- Single steerable nose wheel and twin rear gear
- Special aluminum-infused rubber tires withstand high temperatures
- Tires pressurized to 400 psi with nitrogen
- 40-foot drag chute deployed at touchdown

### Cockpits
- Forward cockpit for pilot, rear cockpit for Reconnaissance Systems Officer (RSO)
- Triple display indicator showing KEAS, altitude, and Mach
- Manual controls for inlet spikes if needed
- Fuel management controls to maintain proper balance
- Environmental controls for cockpit temperature
- Climate-controlled flight suits for crew
- Windows with inner and outer panes to handle extreme temperatures

### Reconnaissance Equipment
- Interchangeable nose with different radar types or optical bar camera
- Optical bar camera used 10,500 feet of 5-inch wide film
- Technical objective cameras for detailed photography
- Signal recorders to capture hostile radar and missile systems
- Astro Inertial Navigation System tracked stars to pinpoint location within 300 feet

### Terms
- Blackbird - Nickname for the Lockheed SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft
- Mach - Measurement of speed relative to the speed of sound (Mach 1 = speed of sound)
- Delta wing - Triangular wing design optimal for supersonic flight
- Chines - Sharp edges along the fuselage that create vortices for additional lift
- Nacelle - Compartment housing the jet engine and inlet spike
- Elevons - Combined elevator and aileron control surfaces on delta wings
- JP-7 - Specialized fuel developed for the SR-71 with high ignition point
- TEB (Triethylborane) - Chemical used to ignite JP-7 fuel that ignites on contact with air
- Inlet spike - Adjustable cone at the front of the engine intake that manages shock waves
- Inlet unstart - Condition where shock waves become misaligned, causing sudden thrust loss
- RSO - Reconnaissance Systems Officer who operated onboard equipment and navigation
- Angle of attack - The angle between the aircraft's longitudinal axis and its direction of travel
- ANS (Astro Inertial Navigation System) - Star-tracking navigation system used for precise location
