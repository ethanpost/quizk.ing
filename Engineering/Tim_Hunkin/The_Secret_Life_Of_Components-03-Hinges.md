## Hinges Overview

### Door Hinges
- Traditional door hinges require rebating into frame and door
- Most important tool is a sharp chisel
- Cut slightly inside the line to ensure proper fit
- Multiple cuts needed to achieve proper depth
- Depth should match thickness of hinge metal
- Screws must be positioned in the middle
- Use dot punch or centering drills for accurate positioning
- Practice on scrap wood before working on actual door frame

### Hinges for Prototypes
- Conventional hinges useful for making prototypes
- Welded to steel frames rather than wood
- Start with cardboard strips and drawing pins for initial testing
- Move to metal version with welded hinges for load testing
- One-inch hinges for small things, two-inch for larger projects
- Two-inch hinges provide better side-to-side stiffness
- Hinges can be reused by grinding them off

### Cupboard Hinges
- Piano hinge preferred over separate hinges for control panels
- Piano hinge is very thin because load is spread throughout length
- No need to rebate - can be mounted flush
- Use pilot holes for screws
- Screws must lie flush with hinge edge to allow proper closing
- Face fitting doors easier than flush fitting for avoiding imperfections

### Kitchen Cabinet Hinges
- Special hinges with multiple adjustment screws
- Require 35mm hole drilled first
- Two-part system: one part in door, one in frame
- Adjustable for up/down, in/out, and twist
- Easier to work with on bench than under cupboard
- Cranked hinge simpler alternative - just screws into face of wood

### Hinges for Glass Doors
- Custom-made using stainless steel
- Stainless steel difficult to work with due to poor heat conduction
- Use thick-walled stainless tube for hinge barrel
- 13.5mm outside diameter, 7.5mm internal diameter
- Drill out to 8.5mm for final size
- Weld barrel to plates that fix to glass
- Use studding as pin with locktight nut on one end
- Holes in glass should be 35mm from edge

### Custom Hinges
- Made from 25mm bar drilled on lathe
- Use ball bearings for friction-free movement
- Bushings or steel-on-steel also acceptable
- Hinge positioning requires geometric calculation
- Use protractors to draw arcs from door ends
- Find intersection point for hinge location
- Angled protractor measures rotation angle
- Swivel hinge around until it coincides with calculated line

### Giant Hinges
- Bigger hinges have steel washers between brass leaves
- Steel wears less quickly than brass under heavy loads
- Consider load distribution and attachment points
- Wheels and rollers help take strain off hinges
- Rotterdam flood barrier has largest hinges with underwater rollers

### Tiny Hinges
- MEMS (Micro Electromechanical Systems) etched from silicon
- Too small to see with naked eye
- Used in mobile phones and video projectors
- Mirrors hinged on thin springy silicon
- Electrostatic forces tilt mirrors by 15 degrees
- HD projector has 2 million of these micro hinges
- Model airplane hinges preferred over doll house hinges
- Radio control model plane hinges have good strength

### Tufnol Hinges
- Made from Tufnol plastic (rigid with embedded cloth layers)
- Use masonry nail as hinge pin
- Oversized hole in moving part, undersized in fixed part
- Hammer nail in for tight fit
- Extremely hard-wearing - tested over 55,000 cycles
- Steel masonry nail provides good wear resistance

### Screw Thread Hinges
- Custom-made for wooden figures
- Six holes total - four for mounting, two for threading
- Use 1mm thick, 6mm wide metal
- 2.5mm holes, 3mm tap for threading
- Cut in two pieces and thread onto 3mm studding
- Use high-strength loctite to lock one end
- Wind until solid, then back off slightly
- Allows easy removal and replacement of parts

### Animation Hinges
- For stop motion animation figures
- Use old-fashioned pins found on eBay
- Drill through all layers of character
- Cut pins to 1-2mm above surface
- Rivet ends to prevent parts falling off
- Use magnetic tape to hold character on steel sheet
- Much faster than glue-based joints
- Allows quick experimentation with character movement

### Terms
- Rebating - Cutting a recess in wood to fit a hinge flush
- Piano hinge - Continuous hinge that runs full length of door
- Face fitting - Door mounted on front of frame rather than flush
- Cranked hinge - Simple hinge that screws into face of wood
- MEMS - Micro Electromechanical Systems, tiny silicon devices
- Tufnol - Rigid plastic with embedded cloth layers
- Clevis - Springy metal connector used in model planes
- Dot punch - Tool for marking center points for drilling
- Centering drill - Special drill bit that automatically centers holes
- Studding - Threaded rod used as hinge pin
- Locktight - Thread-locking compound to prevent loosening
- Rivet - Process of deforming metal to create permanent joint
