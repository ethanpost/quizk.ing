### Etymology and Definition
- Origin of the word "geometry"
  - "Geo" = earth
  - "Metry" = measurement
- Geometry is the study of shapes, space, and how they relate
  - Includes lines, triangles, circles, angles
  - Encompasses patterns and three-dimensional shapes
  - Covers almost all visually mathematical concepts

### Fundamental Concepts: Points
- Definition: A point is a position in space
  - Cannot move on a point
  - Has zero dimensions
- Points are labeled with letters (A, B, C, D, etc.)
- Points serve as reference positions

### Line Segments
- Definition: All points connecting two endpoints in a straight line
  - One-dimensional figure
  - Can move back and forth along one direction
  - Has finite length
- Notation: Line segment AB is written as AB̅
  - Order of endpoints doesn't matter (AB̅ = BA̅)
- Length notation: AB = 5 units (without the line above)
- Endpoints: The points at either end of a line segment

### Rays
- Definition: Starts at a point and extends infinitely in one direction
  - One-dimensional figure
  - Has a starting point (vertex) but no endpoint in one direction
- Notation: Ray AD is written as AD⃗
  - Order matters (AD⃗ ≠ DA⃗)

### Lines
- Definition: Extends infinitely in both directions
  - One-dimensional figure
  - Has no endpoints
- Notation: Line EF is written as EF↔
- Lines never end in either direction

### Additional Concepts
- Colinear points: Points that lie on the same line
- Midpoint: A point exactly halfway between two other points
  - If XZ = ZY and X, Y, Z are colinear, Z is the midpoint of XY

### Dimensions
- Zero-dimensional: Points (no movement possible)
- One-dimensional: Lines, line segments, rays (movement in one direction)
- Two-dimensional: Planes, surfaces (movement in two directions)
- Three-dimensional: Space (movement in three directions)
- Higher dimensions exist in advanced mathematics

### Terms
- Point - A position in space with zero dimensions
- Line segment - A straight path between two endpoints with finite length
- Ray - A line that starts at a point and extends infinitely in one direction
- Line - A straight path that extends infinitely in both directions
- Endpoint - A point at the end of a line segment
- Vertex - The starting point of a ray
- Colinear - Points that lie on the same line
- Midpoint - A point exactly halfway between two other points
- Dimension - The number of independent directions in which movement is possible
- Plane - A flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely
