## Hinges Overview

### Door Hinges
- Traditional door hinges require rebating into frame and door
- Most important tool is a sharp chisel
- Cut slightly inside the line to ensure proper fit
- Multiple cuts needed to achieve proper depth
- Depth should match thickness of hinge metal
- Screws must be positioned in the middle
- Use dot punch or centering drills for accurate positioning
- Practice on scrap wood before working on actual door frame

### Hinges for Prototypes
- Conventional hinges useful for making prototypes
- Welded to steel frames rather than wood
- Start with cardboard strips and drawing pins for initial testing
- Move to metal version with welded hinges for load testing
- One-inch hinges for small things, two-inch for larger projects
- Two-inch hinges provide better side-to-side stiffness
- Hinges can be reused by grinding them off

### Cupboard Hinges
- Piano hinge preferred over separate hinges for control panels
- Piano hinge is very thin because load is spread throughout length
- No need to rebate - can be mounted flush
- Use pilot holes for screws
- Screws must lie flush with hinge edge to allow proper closing
- Face fitting doors easier than flush fitting for avoiding imperfections

### Kitchen Cabinet Hinges
- Special hinges with multiple adjustment screws
- Require 35mm hole drilled first
- Two-part system: one part in door, one in frame
- Adjustable for up/down, in/out, and twist
- Easier to work with on bench than under cupboard
- Cranked hinge simpler alternative - just screws into face of wood

### Hinges for Glass Doors
- Custom-made using stainless steel
- Stainless steel difficult to work with due to poor heat conduction
- Use thick-walled stainless tube for hinge barrel
- 13.5mm outside diameter, 7.5mm internal diameter
- Drill out to 8.5mm for final size
- Weld barrel to plates that fix to glass
- Use studding as pin with locktight nut on one end
- Holes in glass should be 35mm from edge

### Custom Hinges
- Made from 25mm bar drilled on lathe
- Use ball bearings for friction-free movement
- Bushings or steel-on-steel also acceptable
- Hinge positioning requires geometric calculation
- Use protractors to draw arcs from door ends
- Find intersection point for hinge location
- Angled protractor measures rotation angle
- Swivel hinge around until it coincides with calculated line

### Giant Hinges
- Bigger hinges have steel washers between brass leaves
- Steel wears less quickly than brass under heavy loads
- Consider load distribution and attachment points
- Wheels and rollers help take strain off hinges
- Rotterdam flood barrier has largest hinges with underwater rollers

### Tiny Hinges
- MEMS (Micro Electromechanical Systems) etched from silicon
- Too small to see with naked eye
- Used in mobile phones and video projectors
- Mirrors hinged on thin springy silicon
- Electrostatic forces tilt mirrors by 15 degrees
- HD projector has 2 million of these micro hinges
- Model airplane hinges preferred over doll house hinges
- Radio control model plane hinges have good strength

### Tufnol Hinges
- Made from Tufnol plastic (rigid with embedded cloth layers)
- Use masonry nail as hinge pin
- Oversized hole in moving part, undersized in fixed part
- Hammer nail in for tight fit
- Extremely hard-wearing - tested over 55,000 cycles
- Steel masonry nail provides good wear resistance

### Screw Thread Hinges
- Custom-made for wooden figures
- Six holes total - four for mounting, two for threading
- Use 1mm thick, 6mm wide metal
- 2.5mm holes, 3mm tap for threading
- Cut in two pieces and thread onto 3mm studding
- Use high-strength loctite to lock one end
- Wind until solid, then back off slightly
- Allows easy removal and replacement of parts

### Animation Hinges
- For stop motion animation figures
- Use old-fashioned pins found on eBay
- Drill through all layers of character
- Cut pins to 1-2mm above surface
- Rivet ends to prevent parts falling off
- Use magnetic tape to hold character on steel sheet
- Much faster than glue-based joints
- Allows quick experimentation with character movement

### Terms
- Rebating - Cutting a recess in wood to fit a hinge flush
- Piano hinge - Continuous hinge that runs full length of door
- Face fitting - Door mounted on front of frame rather than flush
- Cranked hinge - Simple hinge that screws into face of wood
- MEMS - Micro Electromechanical Systems, tiny silicon devices
- Tufnol - Rigid plastic with embedded cloth layers
- Clevis - Springy metal connector used in model planes
- Dot punch - Tool for marking center points for drilling
- Centering drill - Special drill bit that automatically centers holes
- Studding - Threaded rod used as hinge pin
- Locktight - Thread-locking compound to prevent loosening
- Rivet - Process of deforming metal to create permanent joint

## Complete Answer Key

1. **What is the most important tool for installing door hinges?**
   - Answer: B) Sharp chisel
   - Explanation: A sharp chisel is essential for cutting the recess (rebate) in the door frame and door where the hinge sits flush. This creates a clean, precise fit that allows the door to close properly.

2. **What type of hinge does Tim prefer for control panel doors?**
   - Answer: A) Piano hinge
   - Explanation: Piano hinges run the full length of the door and are preferred because they're thin, strong, and don't require rebating. They distribute the load evenly along the entire length, making them ideal for control panels.

3. **Why does Tim use piano hinge instead of separate hinges for cupboard doors?**
   - Answer: C) The load is spread throughout the whole length
   - Explanation: Unlike individual hinges that concentrate weight at specific points, piano hinges distribute the door's weight evenly across their entire length. This prevents sagging and provides better support for heavier doors.

4. **What material does Tim use for glass door hinges?**
   - Answer: C) Stainless steel
   - Explanation: Stainless steel is used for glass door hinges because it's corrosion-resistant and won't rust when exposed to moisture. This is especially important for glass doors that might be used in bathrooms or outdoor applications.

5. **What are MEMS hinges made from?**
   - Answer: D) Silicon
   - Explanation: MEMS (Micro Electromechanical Systems) hinges are etched from silicon wafers using semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Silicon is chosen because it can be precisely shaped at microscopic scales and has good electrical properties for the electrostatic actuators.

6. **How many micro hinges does an HD projector contain?**
   - Answer: A) 2 million
   - Explanation: HD projectors use digital micromirror devices (DMD) with millions of tiny silicon mirrors, each mounted on micro hinges. These mirrors tilt to reflect light and create the projected image, with 2 million mirrors providing high resolution.

7. **What material is Tufnol?**
   - Answer: B) Rigid plastic with embedded cloth layers
   - Explanation: Tufnol is a composite material made from layers of cloth (usually cotton or linen) embedded in phenolic resin. This creates a strong, rigid plastic that's excellent for making durable hinges and mechanical parts.

8. **What is a clevis?**
   - Answer: A) A springy metal connector for model planes
   - Explanation: A clevis is a U-shaped metal connector with holes for pins. In model airplanes, clevises provide a flexible connection between control rods and control surfaces, allowing for easy adjustment and smooth movement.

9. **What does Tim use to lock the studding in screw thread hinges?**
   - Answer: C) High-strength loctite
   - Explanation: High-strength loctite is a thread-locking compound that prevents threaded connections from loosening due to vibration or movement. It's stronger than regular loctite and creates a permanent bond that can only be broken with heat.
