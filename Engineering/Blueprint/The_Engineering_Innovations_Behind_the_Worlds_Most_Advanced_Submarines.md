### Virginia Class Submarine Overview
- 377 feet long, can dive to depths greater than 800 feet
- Speeds greater than 25 knots
- Nuclear-powered fast attack submarine
- Reduced construction time from 15 million hours to 10 million hours
- Weighs 7,800 tons (equivalent to 40 blue whales)
- Can operate in shallow waters with pinpoint accuracy
- Benchmark for all ships in stealth, endurance, and versatility

### Historical Development of Submarines
- Ancient sponge divers used weighted rocks to reach seabed
- 5th century BC: Greek diver Scyllis breathed underwater using hollow reed
- Alexander the Great reportedly used glass barrel for underwater observation
- 1775: David Bushnell's "Turtle" - first submersible used in combat
  - Used hand-cranked propeller and ballast tank
  - Attempted to attach explosives to British ships
- Pre-WWII submarines were essentially surface ships with diving capability
  - Limited to 48 hours underwater

### Revolutionary Hull Design
- Admiral Charles Momsen developed teardrop hull form
- Tested over 25 large-scale models
- 1953: USS Albacore introduced revolutionary teardrop hull design
  - Dramatically reduced both frictional and form drag
  - Created faster, more maneuverable submarine
  - Became baseline for all modern submarines
- Virginia class construction requires strict circularity requirements
  - 5,000 tons of force used to form steel into submarine shape
  - Modules built separately then assembled

### Nuclear Propulsion Breakthrough
- Captain Hyman Rickover pioneered nuclear submarine propulsion
- 1954: USS Nautilus launched as first nuclear-powered submarine
  - Traveled 1,300 miles in less than 90 hours fully submerged
  - Only needed refueling every 2 years
- Virginia class features life-of-ship nuclear core
  - Never needs refueling during 33-year lifespan
  - Can travel over 1.5 million km without refueling
  - Allows submarine to hover motionless for weeks

### Life Support Systems
- Early submarines faced oxygen depletion and CO2 buildup
- William Nicholson's electrolysis process adapted for submarines
  - Splits water into hydrogen and oxygen
  - Virginia class uses Advanced Integrated Low Pressure Electrolyzer
  - Creates over 200 cubic feet of oxygen per hour
- CO2 removal through amine-based removal plant
- Emergency escape systems include Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment (SEIE) suit
  - Provides fresh breathing air during compression and ascent
  - 75 pounds of positive buoyancy
  - Travels at 625 feet per minute through water
  - Tested to depths of 600 feet

### Advanced Technology Features
- Replaced traditional periscope with photonic mast system
  - Sophisticated camera system displayed on widescreen monitors
  - Allows control room to be located on wider second deck
- Sophisticated sonar arrays for mapping ocean floor
- Advanced propeller (propulsor) for silent operation
- Acoustically the stealthiest submarine in US Navy history

### Terms
- Ballast Tank - A compartment that can be filled with water or air to control the buoyancy of a submarine.
- Teardrop Hull - A streamlined submarine hull design that reduces drag underwater, introduced by Admiral Charles Momsen.
- Electrolysis - The process of using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, used to generate breathable air in submarines.
- Photonic Mast - An advanced camera system that replaces traditional periscopes on modern submarines.
- Propulsor - An advanced propeller system designed for silent operation.
- Frictional Drag - Resistance created by the friction between a submarine's hull and the water.
- Form Drag - Resistance created by water separating from the hull, causing eddies.
- Pressurized Water Reactor - A type of nuclear reactor that uses pressurized water to transfer heat from the reactor core to a secondary water loop.
- SEIE Suit - Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment, a specialized suit designed to allow submariners to escape from a disabled submarine.
- Virginia Class - A class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines built for the United States Navy.
