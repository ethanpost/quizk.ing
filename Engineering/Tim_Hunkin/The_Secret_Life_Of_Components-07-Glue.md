## Glue Overview

### History and Development
- Earliest known glue: pitch used for axe heads in Stone Age
- Animal hide glues: made from boiling fish scales, rabbit skin, or hides
- Plant-based glues: flour and water paste, wallpaper paste (starch-based)
- Latex glues: most widely used natural glues today
- Synthetic glues: invented mostly by German chemists in mid-20th century

### What Makes a Glue
- Two basic properties required:
  - Must stick to surfaces (form intimate contact, wet the surface)
  - Must set/harden (by cooling, evaporation, or chemical reaction)
- Bonding methods: mechanical interlocking, weak intermolecular forces, or chemical reaction

### Types of Glues Covered
- PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol) - 1924
- Polyurethanes - 1937
- Epoxy - 1934
- Super glue (cyanoacrylate) - 1942
- Methacrylates (Loctite) - 1953
- Contact glues
- Hot glue
- Chemical anchors
- Solvent plastic glues
- E6000 glue

### Terms
- PVA - Polyvinyl alcohol glue, commonly used for wood, waterproof version dries clear
- Polyurethane glue - Sets by moisture reaction, foams up with CO2 gas, good for gap filling
- Epoxy - Two-part glue for metals, requires mixing equal quantities
- Super glue - Cyanoacrylate adhesive, works well with activator for wood carving
- Contact glue - Latex-based adhesive that bonds on contact, used for laminates
- Hot glue - Thermoplastic adhesive applied hot, good for prototypes
- Chemical anchor - Two-part mortar-like glue for fixing steel to concrete
- Solvent glue - Melts plastic to create welded joint, no glue layer remains
- E6000 - Super sticky silicone-based glue for waterproof applications
- Copydex - Latex glue with ammonia for cloth-to-cloth bonding
- Loctite - Thread-locking adhesive for preventing nuts from loosening
- Double-sided tape - Pressure-sensitive adhesive for metal joining
