### Introduction to Machiavelli
- Florentine diplomat who served the republic for 14 years (1498-1512)
- Wrote The Prince after being exiled when the Medici returned to power
- Compared himself to Columbus for discovering "new modes and orders" in politics
- Called himself a discoverer of an entirely new political continent

### Machiavelli's Context and Background
- Lived during the Italian Renaissance in Florence
- Grew up under Medici rule, witnessed Savonarola's brief theocracy
- Served as secretary to the second chancery (diplomatic post)
- Wrote his major works from political exile
- Described his study habits in letter to Francesco Vettori

### Machiavelli's Revolutionary Approach
- Broke with traditional Christian and classical political thought
- Focused on "effectual truth" rather than idealized politics
- Rejected both Christian universalism and the ancient republic model
- Created a new form of political organization: the modern state
- Emancipated politics from Christian and classical conceptions of virtue

### The Prince: Structure and Purpose
- Initially appears conventional as a "mirror of princes" guidebook
- Actually focuses on "new princes" who create their own authority
- Dedicated to Lorenzo de Medici but aimed at potential princes
- Distinguishes between republics and principalities
- Further divides principalities into hereditary and new

### The New Prince and Prophetic Leadership
- The new prince is a self-made political founder
- Must imitate great founders like Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and Theseus
- Takes advantage of opportunity and imposes form on political matter
- Distinguished between "armed prophets" (who conquer) and "unarmed prophets" (who fail)
- Possesses exceptional qualities that allow them to bring laws and reform opinions

### Machiavellian Virtue (Virtù)
- Redefines traditional notions of good and evil, virtue and vice
- Virtù relates to "manliness" and effectiveness, not moral goodness
- Focuses on extreme situations where conventional morality may be suspended
- Normalizes states of emergency as the typical condition of politics
- Believes human nature reveals itself only in moments of crisis

### The Model of Cesare Borgia
- Represented Machiavelli's ideal of princely virtù
- Demonstrated calculated use of cruelty through his treatment of Ramiro d'Orco
- Used a subordinate to impose harsh order, then executed him publicly
- Left the people "satisfied and stupefied" through shock and awe
- Showed how to purge hatred by transferring blame to subordinates

### Terms
- Virtù - Machiavellian concept of political effectiveness and manliness, derived from the Latin word for "man" (vir)
- Effectual Truth - Machiavelli's focus on political reality rather than idealized politics
- Armed Prophet - A political founder who uses force to establish new orders and succeeds
- Unarmed Prophet - A leader who attempts to establish new orders without force and fails
- New Prince - A ruler who creates their own authority rather than inheriting it
- New Modes and Orders - Machiavelli's term for his revolutionary political innovations
- Principality - One of two regime types in Machiavelli's classification (the other being republic)
- Occasion/Opportunity - The chance circumstances that allow a prince to demonstrate virtù
- Form and Matter - Aristotelian terms repurposed by Machiavelli to describe how a prince imposes order
