## Outline

### Introduction to 2D vs 3D CAD
- Common mistake: jumping straight into 3D CAD
- The importance of mastering 2D first
- 3D modeling is like running before learning to walk

### Understanding 2D CAD
- Definition: 2D stands for "two dimensions"
- Conceptual framework: like drawing on a flat piece of paper
- Example: Creating a washer in 2D (just two circles)
- 2D sketches serve as the foundation for 3D models

### Understanding 3D CAD
- Definition: 3D stands for "three dimensions"
- Process: Adding thickness to 2D sketches to create models
- Purpose: Creating a digital workbench for making parts
- 3D models are built upon 2D foundations

### The Foundation Analogy
- 2D sketches are like the foundation of a house
- 3D models are like the house built on that foundation
- Poor foundation leads to poor house (falls apart in 10 years)
- Poor 2D sketches lead to poor 3D models that break

### Core Principle: 2D Drives 3D
- The fundamental concept of the lesson
- 2D sketches determine the quality of 3D models
- This principle sets up future lessons on 2D building blocks

### Preview of Next Lesson
- Focus will shift to origins and planes
- Building blocks of 2D CAD will be covered
- Foundation for understanding 2D sketching fundamentals

### Terms
- **2D CAD** – Computer-aided design using two dimensions, like drawing on a flat piece of paper
- **3D CAD** – Computer-aided design using three dimensions, adding thickness to create models
- **Sketch** – A 2D drawing that serves as the foundation for 3D models
- **Model** – A 3D representation of a part created from 2D sketches
- **Foundation** – The 2D sketch that serves as the base for building 3D models
- **Digital workbench** – The CAD environment where parts are created and modified

## Master Answer Key

1. C – Going straight into 3D is the biggest mistake because it skips the foundational 2D skills needed for quality models.

2. D – 2D stands for "two dimensions," referring to the flat, two-dimensional nature of sketches.

3. C – 2D CAD is best thought of as drawing on a flat piece of paper, which helps visualize the sketching process.

4. C – A washer in 2D requires two circles (inner and outer) to represent the hole and outer edge.

5. B – Adding thickness to a 2D sketch transforms it into a 3D model by giving it depth.

6. C – 3D CAD is described as a digital workbench where parts are created and modified.

7. D – In the foundation analogy, 2D sketches represent the foundation that everything else is built upon.

8. B – 3D models represent the house that is built on the 2D foundation.

9. C – A house built on a poor foundation will fall apart in about 10 years, just like poor 2D sketches lead to failing 3D models.

10. D – The core principle is "2D drives 3D," meaning the quality of 2D sketches determines the quality of 3D models.

11. C – The next lesson will focus on origins and planes, which are fundamental building blocks of 2D CAD.

12. B – True, the lesson uses this analogy to emphasize that 3D modeling requires mastering 2D skills first.

13. A – False, a washer requires two circles (inner and outer) to properly represent its geometry.

14. B – True, poor 2D sketches will inevitably lead to poor 3D models that break or fail.
