## Pneumatics Overview

### Basic Principles
- Air power/pneumatics has ancient origins (blow guns, bellows)
- Roman times: bellows powered organs
- Medieval churches: bellows operators for organs
- 18th century: tiny bellows for cuckoo clocks
- 19th century breakthrough: metal cylinders for compression and actuation
- Modern compressors: electric motors with pistons running thousands of RPM
- Air is compressible (springy) vs. hydraulic oil (incompressible)
- Pneumatics: either fully in or fully out (can't stop mid-stroke)

### Basic Pneumatic Cylinders
- Wide range of sizes from tiny to very large
- Scaling advantage: works well from big to tiny applications
- Difference from hydraulic cylinders: air vs. oil, lower pressure (4-6 bar vs. hundreds of bar)
- Air pressure: 4-6 bar typical
- Hydraulic pressure: up to 200+ bar
- Compressed air is springy/compressible
- Hydraulic oil is incompressible
- Pneumatic limitation: can't stop cylinder halfway
- Chinese cylinders: cheaper but more friction, good for dual-direction power

### Pressure and Units
- Pressure = Force ÷ Area
- Force = Air pressure × Cross-sectional area of cylinder
- Example: 40 PSI × 2 square inches = 80 pounds force
- Units are confusing: PSI, pascals, megapascals, torr, kg/cm²
- One atmosphere = 1 bar = 14.5 PSI
- 100 kilopascals ≈ 1 bar
- Compressors typically output 6 bar

### Air Compressors
- Standard layout: motor + compressor + tank
- Tank provides reservoir so motor doesn't run constantly
- Solenoid valve: vents air during startup to reduce load
- Quiet compressors: ~42 decibels vs. 90-95 decibels
- Similar to fridge compressor but pumps air instead of refrigerant
- Not continuously rated - need timers (5 min on, 5 min off)
- Air gets very hot during compression
- Simple valve design: springy metal strips for intake/exhaust
- Screw compressors: two helixes mesh together, trap air pockets
- Screw compressors: continuous flow, no valves, expensive

### Regulators and Filters
- Pressure regulator: controls output pressure
- Simple design: spring + rubber + plate + button
- Digital regulators: 0-10V analog input controls pressure
- Pressure switch: turns motor on/off based on tank pressure
- Differential: difference between cut-in and cut-out pressure
- Filters: remove water condensation and oil from compressed air
- Manual vs. automatic drain systems
- Clean air needed for paint spraying

### Tubing and Fittings
- Polyurethane tubing preferred over nylon (more flexible)
- Polyurethane: can be crimped with cable ties for airtight joints
- Laboratory tube clamps work well with polyurethane
- Tubing sizes: 2mm to 10mm+
- Quick fittings: threaded end + push-fit end
- Spring steel ring grips tubing, blue ring releases it
- Custom fittings: brass tube + rod, soldered together
- Small tubing reduces air flow but maintains force

### Speed Control
- Speed controllers restrict air flow out of cylinder
- Arrows indicate direction: full pressure in, restricted flow out
- Fine control over movement speed in both directions
- Essential for most applications

### Pneumatic Valves
- Simple tap valves: basic on/off
- Solenoid valves: electric control
- Problem: air trapped in cylinder when valve off
- Solution: exhaust port to vent trapped air
- 5/2 valve: 2 outputs (one to each end of cylinder) + pressure inlet + 2 exhausts
- Silencers reduce noise
- Spool valve: rod with seals moves to block/unblock different routes
- Air-assisted: solenoid opens tiny holes, compressed air moves main spool
- Manifolds: multiple valves in one block, reduces tubing

### Exotic Cylinders
- Compact cylinders: better extension ratio (35% vs. 20%)
- Back-to-back compact cylinders: central stop position
- Reed switches: detect magnet in piston for position sensing
- Hexagonal shafts: prevent piston rotation
- Guide bars: prevent rotation, resist side loads
- Linear actuators: beefy guide bars for full linear motion
- Grippers: parallel jaw movement
- Rotary cylinders: rotational motion
- Rodless rams: carriage moves almost entire cylinder length
- Rodless ram seal: flexible strip allows connecting rod to piston
- Magnetic rodless rams: rare earth magnet attracts steel carriage
- Air-powered tools: staplers, nailers, rivet guns, impact wrenches, drills, spray guns, sanders
- Air rivet gun: ungainly but useful and cheap
- Dentist drill: turbine, not cylinder

### Vacuum & Low Pressure Pneumatics
- Atmospheric railways: 19th century trains with pistons in vacuum tubes
- Vacuum tube systems: banks and department stores until 1960s-70s
- Modern applications: hospitals
- Maximum vacuum: 1 atmosphere (1 bar)
- Vacuum less powerful than compressed air (6 bar)
- Vacuum powerful over large areas
- Domestic lift: 24" diameter, tiny negative pressure needed
- Venturi effect: compressed air creates vacuum
- Bellows: low pressure pneumatics for automata
- Industrial applications still exist

### Pneumatic Extravaganza
- London Zoo clock: 35 cylinders, 15 years running
- Escapement: 80 million cycles
- Victorian attitude to natural world theme
- Maintenance challenges: compressor oil, water condensation, rat damage
- Flying birds: reliability issues over time

### Air Power vs. Electric
- Electric advantages: less energy, can stop mid-stroke, precise positioning, fast movement
- Pneumatic advantages: simple, reliable, long life, no limits switches needed
- KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid
- Electric more complex = more maintenance issues
- Pneumatic survives due to simplicity and reliability
