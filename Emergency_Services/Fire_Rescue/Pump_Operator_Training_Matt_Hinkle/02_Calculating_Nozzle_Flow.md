### Types of Nozzles and Operating Pressures
- Smoothbore Handline
  - Operates at 50 PSI standard pressure
  - No pattern or gallonage adjustment
  - Flow changes only by changing tip size
  - Under/over pressurization affects flow quality

- Smoothbore Master Stream
  - Operates at 80 PSI standard pressure
  - Uses stack tips for size changes
  - Larger openings (up to 2 inches)
  - Can exceed 1,000 GPM flow

- Fog/Combination Nozzle
  - Standard calculation pressure: 100 PSI
  - Available in 75 PSI and 50 PSI versions
  - May have selectable or fixed gallonage
  - Pattern and flow adjustable on some models

### GPM Formula Components
- Formula: GPM = 29.7 × diameter² × √nozzle pressure
- 29.7 is a constant value
- Diameter refers to nozzle tip size
- Nozzle pressure varies by type
  - Smoothbore Handline: 50 PSI
  - Master Stream: 80 PSI
  - Fog Nozzle: 100 PSI

### Terms
- GPM - Gallons Per Minute
- PSI - Pounds per Square Inch
- Smoothbore Nozzle - A basic nozzle with no pattern adjustment, only flowing straight streams
- Master Stream - Large capacity nozzle typically used on aerial devices or deck guns
- Fog Nozzle - Combination nozzle that can adjust spray patterns and sometimes flow rates
- Stack Tips - Removable nozzle tips of varying sizes used on master stream devices
- Nozzle Pressure - The pressure at which water exits the nozzle
