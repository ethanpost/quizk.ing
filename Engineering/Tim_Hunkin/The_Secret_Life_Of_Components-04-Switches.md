## Basic Switch Concepts

### Basic Switch Operation
- Simple circuit with battery, light bulb, and switch
- Switch completes circuit to allow electricity flow
- Two-way switches allow control from multiple locations

### Switch Arcing
- Occurs when switching higher loads, especially motors
- Electricity flow causes air molecules to become ionized
- Ionized air conducts electricity, creating sparks
- Can cause contacts to weld together permanently

### Arc Suppression Methods
- Rapid contact movement (snap action)
- Spring-loaded mechanisms for quick switching
- Capacitor and resistor suppressors across contacts
- Solid state relays for high-load applications

### Switch Types and Applications
- Push button switches (various sizes and styles)
- Foot switches (workshop applications)
- Rotary switches (multiple positions, binary encoding)
- Rocker switches (rectangular hole mounting)
- Toggle switches (test switches, large loads, reversing)
- Micro switches (most commonly used, various actuators)
- Subminiature switches (space-constrained applications)
- Vandalproof switches (public machine controls)
- Mercury switches (obsolete due to toxicity)

### Micro Switch Details
- Different actuator types (button, lever arm, roller)
- Varying actuation forces (30g to 540g)
- Over-travel specifications
- Low torque variants for coin acceptors
- Limit switch applications with diode circuits

### Terms
- Arc - Electrical discharge through ionized air when switch contacts open/close
- Ionization - Process where air molecules gain or lose electrons, becoming electrically charged
- Micro switch - Small, precise switch with snap-action mechanism
- Solid state relay - Electronic switching device without moving contacts
- Contact resistance - Electrical resistance at switch contact points
- Over-travel - Distance switch actuator can move after switching occurs
- Limit switch - Switch that detects when moving parts reach end positions
- Binary encoding - Converting switch positions to digital signals
- Vandalproof - Designed to withstand rough public use
- Mercury switch - Switch using liquid mercury as conductor (now obsolete)
