## CAD File Types Overview

### Chapter 4 Introduction
- Taking CAD projects into production areas like SendCutSend
- Covering different CAD file types
- Learning how to export files
- Learning how to import files into SendCutSend's website
- Lesson 1 focuses on different CAD file types

### 2D File Types
- Used for 2D machines
- Appropriate for laser cutting and water jetting
- Used for through cuts on 2D machines
- Four main file types: DXF, DWG, SVG, and AI
- DXF is the neutral format for 2D files
- DXF stands for Drawing Exchange Format
- DXF is widely used across the industry
- DXF can be used in all different CAD softwares
- DXF can be used at places like SendCutSend to cut parts
- When thinking 2D, think 2D machine and DXF

### Native File Types
- Files made specifically by a software and used by that software
- AI is a native file type for Adobe Illustrator
- DWG is a native file type for Autodesk
- DWG is more widely used than some other native formats
- Native files can preserve history and timeline when shared within the same software

### 3D File Types
- More complex than 2D file types
- Two different types: 3D solid and 3D mesh
- 3D solid files are like a solid object (e.g., a person's head)
- 3D mesh files are like a hollow version (e.g., papier-mâché mask)
- Solid files are for machining or milling
- Solid files are great for understanding properties like density
- Mesh files are primarily for additive manufacturing like 3D printing
- Mesh files only need to know the outer shape

### 3D Solid Files
- Used for CNC milling
- SolidWorks and Fusion have specific 3D native files
- Native files preserve history and timeline when shared within same software
- STEP is the neutral format for 3D solid files
- STEP stands for Standard Exchange Product Model
- STEP is widely used across all options
- SendCutSend can accept STEP files
- When thinking solid files for CNC milling, think STEP files

### 3D Mesh Files
- Three main mesh files: STL, OBJ, and 3MF
- Used primarily for additive manufacturing like 3D printing
- Don't care about internal structure
- Only need to know the outer shape
- Not the focus when exporting for SendCutSend
- Focus is on 2D files and 3D solid files for SendCutSend

### Terms

- 3D Solid - A type of 3D file that represents a solid object, used for machining or milling operations and great for understanding properties like density.
- 3D Mesh - A type of 3D file that represents a hollow surface model, used primarily for additive manufacturing like 3D printing where only the outer shape matters.

## Master Answer Key

1. **D) DXF** - DXF (Drawing Exchange Format) is the neutral format for 2D CAD files used broadly in CAD and manufacturing.
2. **B) Drawing Exchange Format** - DXF stands for Drawing Exchange Format, commonly used across CAD programs.
3. **D) AI** - AI is the native filetype for Adobe Illustrator.
4. **B) A file that was made specifically by a software and used by that software** - Native files are created for exclusive use by the software in which they were made.
5. **C) 2D machine and DXF** - For 2D CAD work, think about 2D machines and the DXF file type.
6. **B) Solid and mesh** - The two types of 3D files highlighted are solid and mesh.
7. **B) A solid object like a person's head** - A solid file is analogous to a real, solid head rather than a hollow shape.
8. **B) A hollow papier-mâché mask** - The video compares mesh to a hollow object, like a papier-mâché mask.
9. **D) Properties like density** - 3D solid files allow understanding of physical properties like density.
10. **D) STEP** - STEP is the neutral 3D format bridging different CAD tools.
11. **A) Standard Exchange Product Model** - STEP file stands for Standard Exchange Product Model.
12. **D) STEP files** - Use STEP files for CNC milling and 3D solid workflows.
13. **A) STL, OBJ, and 3MF** - The three mesh formats for 3D printing are STL, OBJ, and 3MF.
14. **C) Additive manufacturing like 3D printing** - Mesh files are ideal for additive processes such as 3D printing.
15. **B) Because additive manufacturing processes will change the internal structure** - Mesh files focus on outside boundaries since the inside is rebuilt during printing.
16. **C) 2D files and 3D solid files** - For SendCutSend, main focus is on 2D and 3D solid files, not meshes.
17. **B) They preserve all history and timeline** - Native formats ensure a full record of changes/history moves with the file within the same software.
18. **C) DWG** - DWG is Autodesk's native filetype.
19. **B) Laser cutting and water jetting** - 2D files are for cutting technologies like laser and water jetting.
20. **A) DXF, DWG, SVG, and AI** - The four 2D file types are DXF, DWG, SVG, and AI.
21. **B) Taking CAD projects and bringing them into production areas like SendCutSend** - The chapter centers on moving CAD files into manufacturing with SendCutSend.
