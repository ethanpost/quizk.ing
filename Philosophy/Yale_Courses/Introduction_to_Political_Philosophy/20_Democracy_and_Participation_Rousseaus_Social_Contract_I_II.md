### The General Will
- Central concept in Rousseau's political philosophy
- Answer to problems identified in the Second Discourse (inequality, amour-propre, discontent)
- Foundation of all legitimate authority
- Emphasizes primacy of the will over transcendent sources/standards
- Creates moral freedom through self-imposed law

### The Social Contract
- Fundamental problem: find a form of association that protects individuals while maintaining freedom
- Solution requires "total alienation" of rights to the "entire community"
- Creates sovereignty of the people (popular sovereignty)
- Differs from Hobbes/Locke who created a third-party sovereign
- Transforms natural liberty into civil and moral liberty

### Liberal vs. Republican Freedom
- Liberal freedom (Hobbes/Locke): freedom exists where law is silent
- Republican freedom (Rousseau): freedom comes from acting in conformity with self-imposed law
- Liberals emphasize separation of public and private spheres
- Republicans seek to unite individual and public interests
- Rousseau aims to revive the concept of citizenship (modeled on Rome and Sparta)

### Practical Applications
- General will can only operate in small states
- Not viable in large nation-states with significant inequality
- Skeptical about pure democracy as government form
- Rejects representative government ("sovereignty can never be delegated")
- Legislative authority must always remain with the people

### Legacies of Rousseau
- Influenced French Revolution (particularly Robespierre)
- Impacted Jeffersonian ideas of rural democracy
- Inspired Tocqueville's view of New England townships
- Influenced communal experiments like Israeli kibbutz movement
- Shaped Kant's moral philosophy ("the Newton of the moral universal")
- Inspired both Romanticism and Republicanism
- Influenced American transcendentalism (Emerson, Thoreau)
- Established the "solitary" as artistic/moral visionary

### Terms
- General Will - The collective will of the entire community that represents the common good rather than the sum of individual wills; the only legitimate sovereign according to Rousseau.
- Social Contract - Rousseau's solution to the problem of natural freedom; an agreement where individuals give themselves to the community to ensure equal terms for all.
- Moral Freedom - Freedom that comes from obeying laws one has helped create; contrasts with natural liberty.
- Natural Liberty - The unrestricted freedom of the state of nature; the ability to do anything one's will and power allow.
- Civil Liberty - The freedom protected by the social contract; includes rights to property and security.
- Popular Sovereignty - The doctrine that ultimate authority rests with the people as a whole, not with kings or representatives.
- Amour-propre - A form of self-love dependent on others' opinions; source of human corruption in society.
- Citizen - For Rousseau, a person who actively participates in creating the laws they obey; contrasts with modern "bourgeois."
- Legislator - An extraordinary individual responsible for shaping the general will at the founding of a society.
- Civil Religion - A form of religious sentiment tailored to bring about love and obedience to the general will.
