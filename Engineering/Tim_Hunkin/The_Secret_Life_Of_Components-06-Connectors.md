### Types of Connectors
- Jack plugs - Simple connectors with springy phosphor bronze contacts coated in gold
- Screw connectors - Use screws to clamp wires, including chocolate strip and rising clamp varieties
- Spring clamp terminals - Use springy metal to clamp wires without screws
- Soldered connectors - Wires soldered to terminals, including D-pin connectors
- Punch down connectors - Use forked metal pieces to puncture insulation and make contact
- Crimp connectors - Wires crimped into metal terminals using special pliers

### Wire Attachment Methods
- Screwed connections - Wires screwed into terminals
- Soldered connections - Wires soldered to terminals
- Spring clamps - Wires held by spring pressure
- Crimped connections - Wires crimped into metal terminals

### Safety and Current Ratings
- Connectors rated by current capacity (jack plug: 5 amps, cruise ship: 1.5 megawatts)
- UK mains plug safety features: fuse in every plug, earth pin makes contact first, shutters protect live/neutral pins
- Current measurement requires meter in series with circuit, not across terminals

### Tools and Techniques
- Bootlace ferrules - Metal tubes crimped onto wire ends to prevent stray strands
- Heat shrink tubing - Insulating material that shrinks when heated
- Proper screwdrivers - Must maintain square profile for tight connections
- Specialized crimping pliers - Required for different connector types

### Terms
- Jack plug - A simple connector with springy phosphor bronze contacts coated in gold, rated for about 5 amps
- Chocolate strip - Screw connector strips resembling Toblerone bars, often frustrating to use
- Rising clamp - Improved screw clamp design where the clamp rises to squash the wire
- DIN rail - Metal rail system for mounting industrial connectors
- Bootlace ferrule - Metal tube crimped onto wire end to prevent stray strands and improve connections
- Spring clamp terminal - Connector using springy metal to clamp wires without screws
- D-pin connector - Soldered connector with D-shaped housing and solder buckets for easy soldering
- Solder bucket - Recessed area in D-pin connectors that holds wire while soldering
- Heat shrink tubing - Insulating material that shrinks when heated to protect connections
- Punch down connector - Connector that uses forked metal pieces to puncture insulation and make contact
- IDC connector - Insulation Displacement Connector, a type of punch down connector
- Crimp connector - Connector where wires are crimped into metal terminals using special pliers
- Spade connector - Simple crimp connector with spade-shaped plug and receptacle
- Molex Microfit - High-quality crimp connector system rated up to 5 amps
