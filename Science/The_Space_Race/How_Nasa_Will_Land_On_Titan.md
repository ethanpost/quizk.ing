## Titan Overview

### Physical Characteristics
- Saturn's largest moon
- Only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere
- Atmosphere is four times denser than Earth's
- Atmosphere composed primarily of nitrogen and methane
- Surface temperature creates reverse greenhouse effect
- Surface made of ice frozen as hard as granite rock

### Unique Features
- Active hydrological cycle with liquid methane
- Flowing rivers, lakes, and seas of methane
- Only known world besides Earth with stable liquid on surface
- Variety of environments including rocky shores and vast deserts
- Dunes formed by wind-blown organic material
- Few impact craters indicating active surface renewal
- Contains water in subsurface ocean mixed with salt
- Water occasionally erupts onto surface like slushy lava
- Contains nitrogen, carbon, and organic molecules
- Environment suggests life couldn't exist "as we know it"

## Previous Exploration

### Cassini Mission
- Launched to Saturn in 1997
- Studied Saturn's planetary system from orbit for many years
- Brought Huygens lander as bonus payload
- Named after Dutch astronomer who first discovered Titan

### Huygens Lander
- Named after discoverer of Titan
- Required because thick haze makes distant study impossible
- Spent 2.5 hours floating down to surface via parachute
- Captured images after breaking through dense haze
- Photos transmitted live from over 1 billion km away
- Landed in soft sandy bottom of dried riverbed
- Showed rocks smooth and rounded by erosion (made of ice, not rock)

## Dragonfly Mission

### Mission Overview
- Nuclear-powered helicopter/octocopter
- Will fly on Titan and search for alien life
- Evolution of older balloon plan
- In development since 2017
- Launch window: July 2028
- SpaceX Falcon Heavy booked for launch

### Technical Specifications
- Over 3 meters in length
- Weighs approximately 450 kg on Earth
- Titan's gravity only 14% of Earth's (similar to Earth's moon)
- Octocopter design with eight propeller blades
- Each propeller blade over 1 meter in diameter
- Redundant design allows flight even if one propeller breaks

### Power Source
- Nuclear-powered using radioisotope thermoelectric generator
- Same power source used for Mars rovers since Curiosity (2011)
- Not a nuclear reactor like power plants
- Uses chunk of radioactive plutonium that generates heat as it decays
- Generator converts heat to electricity
- Necessary because too far from Sun and under cloud cover

### Flight Advantages
- Low gravity combined with thick atmosphere makes flying efficient
- Much easier than Mars (37% Earth gravity, less than 1% atmosphere density)
- NASA learned from Ingenuity drone on Mars (72 flights in 3 years)
- Flying is easier way to get around on Titan

## Mission Timeline and Journey

### Launch and Travel
- Launch: July 2028
- Journey involves gravity assists
- First slingshot around Venus using planet's gravity
- Returns to Earth for second gravity assist
- Sets course for Titan
- Total journey: 6 years
- Arrival at Saturn: 2034 (1.2 billion km from Earth)

### Landing Sequence
- Direct ballistic entry (cannonball approach)
- No orbital settling, direct descent
- Entry capsule is heat shield with dome light cover
- Similar heat shield to Perseverance Mars rover (2021)
- Heating phase: 6 minutes
- Supersonic drogue parachute deploys
- 80 minutes descending on first parachute
- Heat shield ejected, main parachute deploys
- Final descent: 20 minutes
- At 1.3 km above surface: cuts loose from parachute
- Deploys own propulsion system (propellers)
- Hovers down for soft landing

### Landing Site
- Region named Shangri-La
- Reference to fictional location in Tibetan Mountains
- From 1933 novel "Lost Horizon" by James Hilton
- More like planet Arrakis from Dune series by Frank Herbert
- Flat plane flanked by gigantic windswept dunes
- Dunes: 1-2 km wide, 100m height, hundreds of km long
- Sand made of solid hydrocarbons (not silicates)
- Like hard grainy snow made from gasoline
- Carbon-based grains are organic compounds

## Scientific Objectives

### Primary Mission Goals
- Search for signs of primitive bacterial life
- Investigate if organic compounds mixed with subsurface water
- Study conditions similar to early Earth
- Look for bio-signatures of primitive life

### Scientific Instruments
- Drill to cut into frozen surface
- Creates loose dust vacuumed into drone
- Sample transported through tubes to collection device
- Each sample stored in individual container
- Laser shoots sample to break down into individual molecules
- Oven vaporizes molecules into gas for further analysis
- Analyzes specific chemistry of samples

### Mission Duration and Scope
- 3 Earth years (764 Titan days)
- Lift off once per Titan day (every 16 Earth days)
- Travel over 180 km total distance
- Explore 24 unique sites
- Majority of time spent on surface taking measurements
- Transmits data back to Earth

### Exploration Areas
- Begins among desert sand dunes
- Final days investigating large crater called Selk
- Selk crater: organic compounds mixed with liquid water after asteroid impact
- Will NOT visit methane seas (retreated to North Pole)
- Landing at polar regions too risky and difficult
