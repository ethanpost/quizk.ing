## How to Plan Your Design for Anodized Finishes Overview

### Introduction to Non-Coated Finishes
- Focus on non-coated finishes that improve appearance and functionality
- Different from additive coating processes like powder coating
- Surface modifications rather than adding protective coatings

### Anodizing Process
- Creates an oxidation layer on parts through an electrochemical process
- Only changes the surface, not adding significant thickness
- Primarily used for aluminum parts
- Creates a hard oxidation layer on the outside of parts

### Benefits of Anodizing
- Corrosion resistance: protects aluminum from chemical corrosion and oxidation
- Durability: oxidation layer acts like a hard shell casing
- Wear resistance: different types (Type 2, Type 3) have different hardnesses
- Cosmetics: dyes can be added during the process to create colors (red, blue, gold)
- Electrical insulation: oxidation layer is not conductive, useful for electrical components

### Important Considerations
- Anodizing is non-conductive: aluminum becomes non-conductive after anodizing
- Welding concerns: must remove anodizing before welding (can be toxic)
- Size increase: oxidation layer increases part size by 5-10 thousandths to 1 thousandth of an inch (about a quarter of a human hair)
- Press fit considerations: for very tight press fits (1.5 thousandths), anodizing can affect the fit
- Recommendation: do machining after anodizing process for tight tolerances

### Other Materials and Processes
- Titanium anodizing: different process using light and electricity for color
- Stainless steel passivation: removes impurities and adds a more robust oxidation layer
- Carbon steel black oxide: traditional process for high carbon steels, adds oxide layer
- All processes: remove existing coating and add specialized coating for better atmosphere control

### Application Process
- Hardware installation timing: hardware installed after anodizing (reacts during process)
- Powder coating timing: hardware installed before powder coating
- Website selection: finishing is the last step in checkout process
- Color selection: various colors available through dropdown menu
- Visual preview: parts show selected finish color in preview

### Terms
- Anodizing - An electrochemical process that creates an oxidation layer on the outside of aluminum parts, providing corrosion resistance, durability, and cosmetic options.
- Oxidation layer - A hard shell-like coating created through anodizing that protects the part from corrosion and wear.
- Corrosion resistance - The ability of a material or finish to resist chemical corrosion and oxidation over time.
- Type 2 anodizing - A type of anodizing process with specific hardness characteristics.
- Type 3 anodizing - A type of anodizing process with different hardness characteristics than Type 2.
- Passivation - A process for stainless steel that removes impurities and adds a more robust oxidation layer.
- Black oxide - A traditional finishing process for high carbon steels that adds an oxide layer to the surface.
- Surface modification - A finishing process that changes the surface of a part rather than adding a coating.
- Electrochemical process - A chemical process that uses electricity to create changes in a material's surface.
- Press fit - A tight mechanical fit where parts are pressed together, typically measured in thousandths of an inch.
