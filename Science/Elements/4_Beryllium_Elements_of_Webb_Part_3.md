### Beryllium on Earth
- Found in rocks in tiny quantities (0.25%)
- Obtained through mining
- Rocks are crushed and processed chemically
- Used in NASA's James Webb Space Telescope

### Cosmic Origins of Elements
- Stars initially form from hydrogen and helium
- Fusion in star cores creates helium from hydrogen
- Fusion produces energy that fuels stars
- When hydrogen depletes, helium atoms begin to fuse
- Fusion continues creating larger elements
- New denser elements cause stars to contract and heat up
- Process stops at iron - insufficient energy for further fusion

### Star Death and Element Creation
- Too much iron means no fuel, causing star death
- Core collapses under pressure
- Atoms collide creating shockwaves
- Star explodes into a supernova
- Supernova explosion creates energy needed for heavier elements
- More than half the periodic table elements form during supernovae

### Beryllium's Unique Formation
- Not created during normal stellar fusion or supernovae
- Has atomic mass of 4 (relatively small)
- Too unstable to form through standard processes
- Forms through cosmic ray spallation
- Cosmic rays hit larger elements during supernovae
- Elements burst into smaller particles
- These particles can become beryllium
- Process makes beryllium extremely rare

### Terms
- Beryllium - Element with atomic mass of 4 used in the James Webb Space Telescope, formed through cosmic ray spallation
- Fusion - Process where atoms combine to form larger elements, releasing energy that powers stars
- Supernova - Explosive death of a star that creates energy needed to form heavier elements
- Cosmic Ray Spallation - Process where cosmic rays hit larger elements, causing them to break into smaller particles
- Iron - Element that marks the end of fusion in stars; accumulation leads to star death
