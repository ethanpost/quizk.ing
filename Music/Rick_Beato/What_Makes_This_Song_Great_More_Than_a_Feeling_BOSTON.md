### Song Background
- Released in September 1976 as first single off Boston's debut album
- Rick Beato recalls learning the intro when he started playing guitar
- The song became a standard guitar piece that everyone had to learn

### Production and Engineering
- Tom Scholz wrote, engineered, and mixed the entire record
- MIT graduate who invented equipment used in the recording
- Created the Rockman and Power Soak amp attenuator
- Recording done on tape in Tom's basement without modern editing capabilities
- No copy/paste in recording - every chorus is unique melodically and texturally

### Guitar Techniques and Sounds
- Song intro fades in, which was uncommon for that era
- Double-tracked acoustic guitars for fuller sound
- Clean electric guitar fills in the mid-range with the 12-string
- "Boston sound" defined by perfectly interlocked instruments
- Beautiful harmonics and whammy bar usage in intro
- "Half-cocked wah" or pointed mid-range 1k EQ boost on guitars
- Pushed mids (opposite of scooped Metallica sound) make guitars jump out
- Pick drags/scrapes used for transitions into choruses
- Hard-panned distorted guitars with acoustic 12-strings for chord definition
- Lo-fi technique: removing bottom end and adding 1k boost

### Bass Playing
- Tom Scholz played bass on almost the entire Boston album
- Fat, compressed bass sound
- Melodic, busy bass style similar to James Jamerson
- Creates chord inversions and harmonic interest
- Uses drop D tuning for one specific note
- Bass often walks up and down octaves during transitions

### Drums
- Sib Hashian on drums
- "Caveman fill" of straight sixteenths before verses
- Side stick with lots of reverb
- Special drum kicks in the out chorus

### Vocals and Melody
- Brad Delp performs lead and backing vocals
- Double-tracked vocals throughout
- ABA melody structure in verses with a C part
- Different timbres in voice, including falsetto and full voice
- High falsetto parts blended under guitar leads
- Chorus melody starts on the root (G)
- Uses sharp 4 to 5 on C chord for beautiful tension
- Harmony parts in thirds
- Hits high D and E notes with no loss in power
- Second verse has altered melody structure with more space
- Guitar and voice harmonize during solo section

### Song Structure
- Introduction with acoustic guitars and harmonics
- Verses with double-tracked vocals
- Pre-chorus with descending line and guitar riff
- Chorus without vocals initially (uncommon in modern music)
- Handclaps during instrumental chorus section
- Chord modulation at end of chorus (G to E flat)
- Transition sections with distinctive walking bass lines
- Guitar solo with dual lead parts
- Out chorus with different chord progression than regular chorus

### Unique Elements
- Human handclaps (not drum machine)
- Guitar and vocal harmonization
- Complex melodic structure
- Multiple transition sections with different functions
- Modulations between sections
- Careful attention to arrangement details

### Terms
- Double-tracking - Recording the same part twice to create a fuller sound
- Attenuator - Device that reduces power of an amplifier without changing tone
- Pick drag/scrape - Guitar technique using the edge of a pick against strings for transition effect
- Half-cocked wah - Guitar sound created by setting a wah pedal in middle position or using EQ to boost mids
- Hard pan - Placing sounds at extreme left or right in stereo field
- Drop D tuning - Lowering the lowest string on guitar from E to D for deeper bass notes
- Modulation - Changing from one key to another within a composition
- Lo-Fi - Recording technique that intentionally reduces audio fidelity, often by filtering frequencies
- ABA melody - Melody structure where the first section repeats after a contrasting middle section
