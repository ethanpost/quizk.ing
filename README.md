# quizk.ing 📚✨

Welcome to **quizk.ing** – a collection of learning content for everyone!

This repository stores educational material sourced primarily from video transcripts and other learning documents. The content is designed to be accessible and engaging, making it a great tool for personal study or family/classroom learning.

This project is currently in "beta" mode, which means I have made major design changes within that past 30 days. 

## 📄 What's Inside

- `.md` files: Markdown files containing question-and-answer style content. These files are formatted for easy import into the [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/) flashcard app (free tier available!).

## 🚀 Purpose

I created this repository to:

- Enhance my own personal learning.
- Assign specific decks to my children to support their education.
- Share useful, bite-sized learning resources with anyone interested.

This is a **work in progress**, and I continue to add new content regularly.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Download any `.md` or `.mochi` file from this repo.
2. Open [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/).
3. Import the file and start reviewing flashcards!

### ⚠️ Note for Importing `.md` Files into Mochi
When importing `.md` files:
- Make sure to specify that there is **more than one question per file**.
- Use `///` as the **separator string** to properly divide each flashcard.

This ensures that all flashcards are imported correctly and organized for easy study.

## 🌱 Contributions & Feedback

Right now, this is a personal project, but I'm always open to ideas, improvements, or collaborations in the future.
