### Basic Geometric Definitions
- Line segment: Has both a starting point and ending point
- Line: Extends infinitely in both directions
- Ray: Has a defined starting point and extends infinitely in one direction

### Visual Representations
- Line segment: Straight line with two endpoints
- Line: Straight line with arrows on both ends
- Ray: Straight line with one endpoint and one arrow

### Real-world Application
- Most lines encountered in everyday reality are actually line segments
- Pure lines (extending infinitely) are abstract mathematical concepts

### Terms
- Line segment: A straight path with a defined starting point and ending point
- Line: A straight path that extends infinitely in both directions
- Ray: A straight path with a defined starting point that extends infinitely in one direction
