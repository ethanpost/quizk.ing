### Basic Definition
- A circle is the set of all points that are a fixed distance from a center point
- Distance from center to any point on circle is constant (radius)

### Key Components
- Center Point
  - Fixed point from which all measurements are taken
  - Not part of the circle itself
- Radius
  - Line segment connecting center to any point on circle
  - Determines size of circle
  - All radii of same circle are equal in length

### Important Lines and Segments
- Tangent Line
  - Intersects circle at exactly one point
  - Touches but does not cross through circle
- Secant Line
  - Intersects circle at two points
  - Extends infinitely in both directions
- Chord
  - Line segment connecting two points on circle
  - Contained within circle
- Diameter
  - Special chord that passes through center
  - Equal to two radii
  - Longest possible chord

### Arcs
- Minor Arc
  - Shorter path between two points along circle
  - Denoted with curved line above points (e.g., JÌ†K)
- Major Arc
  - Longer path between two points along circle
  - Specified using intermediate point (e.g., JTK)

### Terms
- Circle - Set of all points equidistant from a center point
- Radius - Line segment from center to any point on circle
- Tangent Line - Line that intersects circle at exactly one point
- Secant Line - Line that intersects circle at two points
- Chord - Line segment connecting two points on circle
- Diameter - Chord that passes through center of circle
- Arc - Portion of circle between two points
- Minor Arc - Shorter path between two points on circle
- Major Arc - Longer path between two points on circle
