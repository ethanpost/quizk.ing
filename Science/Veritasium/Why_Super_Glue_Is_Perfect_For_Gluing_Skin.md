## History and Development
- Harry Coover discovered cyanoacrylate at Eastman Kodak in 1942
- Initially considered a "severe pain" due to its stickiness when developing clear plastic for gun sights
- Rediscovered in 1951 when coworker Fred Joyner accidentally glued prisms together
- Coover had insight to see its sticking power as beneficial rather than problematic
- Named "Eastman 910 Adhesive" as it was the 910th substance tested
- Now commonly known as super glue

## Chemical Properties and Mechanism
- Liquid super glue consists of identical ethyl cyanoacrylate monomer molecules
- Flows into pores and crevices of surfaces before solidifying
- Polymerization triggered by water/moisture
  - Water molecules initiate formation of polymer chains
  - Oxygen atoms in water are slightly negative and break carbon double bonds
  - Negative hydroxide ions in water also trigger the reaction
- Molecules have two double bonds and one triple bond close together
  - Electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms create reactive carbon
  - In presence of negative ions, carbon double bonds break
  - Forms long polymer chains through chain reaction
- Sets in 10-30 seconds, much faster than glues that require water evaporation
- Polymerization releases heat during setting

## Strength and Weaknesses
- Remarkably strong in tension (25 mega pascals)
  - One drop can support thousands of pounds
  - 5 cm square patch could suspend an African elephant
- Weak points include:
  - Brittle and prone to breaking under impact
  - Weak against shear forces
  - Very susceptible to peeling forces
  - Poor adhesion to smooth surfaces
  - Won't stick to chemically inert materials like polyethylene and polypropylene

## Skin Adhesion
- Perfect for skin due to:
  - Wrinkles and pores for mechanical adhesion
  - Collagen protein has negative regions that initiate polymerization
  - Water content of skin triggers setting
- Some molecules in skin literally become part of the polymer chain
- To remove from skin, use acetone (nail polish remover)
- Never use acetone for eye accidents - seek medical attention

## Medical Applications
- Coover discovered medical potential when used on son's cut
- Developed medical grade super glue with longer carbon chains in the alkyl group
  - Slower polymerization means less heat release
  - Breaks down more slowly, reducing toxicity
  - More flexible for use on living tissue
- Used as spray during Vietnam War to stop severe bleeding
- FDA finally approved medical cyanoacrylate (Dermabond) in 1998
- Now a $900 million per year industry

## Modifications and Special Uses
- Thickening agents like fumed silica added to create gel forms
- Acid added to inhibit polymerization in the tube
- Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) used as accelerator
  - Reacts with moisture to produce hydroxide ions
  - Forms hard composite material that can be drilled or sanded
- Gel forms effective underwater with slower setting time

## Environmental Potential
- Could help solve plastic waste problem
- Can be completely depolymerized at 210Â°C
  - Returns to pure monomers (93% recovery rate)
  - Can be distilled and reactivated into fresh polymer
- Challenges for plastic applications:
  - Sticks to most surfaces (solved using inert plastics like polypropylene for handling)
  - Brittle nature (solved with weak bases and solvents to create longer chains)
- Superior to conventional recycling which degrades plastics and creates microplastics
