## Outline

### Introduction
- Parts may not come out exactly like design due to bending calculations
- Two key calculations needed for bending: bend allowance and bend deduction
- Prerequisites: understanding key terms from previous lesson

### Key Terms and Variables
- Angle: the bend angle in the calculation
- Pi (π): mathematical constant used as 3.14 in all calculations
- Bend radius: radius of the bend
- K factor: midline thickness divided by original material thickness
- Material thickness: overall thickness of the material

### Bend Allowance
- Definition: length of the adjusted center line after bending
- After-bent adjustment or measurement
- Measured from tangent point to tangent point
- Accounts for elongation and stretching during bending
- Formula includes: angle, pi, bend radius, K factor, and thickness
- Factors affecting bend allowance:
  - Angle: changing angle changes overall length of adjusted midline
  - Bend radius: larger radius means longer midline and more deformation
  - K factor: material-dependent constant (varies for stainless steel, steel, aluminum)
  - Material thickness: thicker material requires more yielding and more bend allowance
- Used to predict final center line distance
- Analogy: like a quarterback throwing to where receiver will be, not where they are

### Bend Deduction
- Definition: amount to subtract from original part before bending
- Pre-bent calculation (before bending)
- Formula includes: bend radius, thickness, angle, and bend allowance
- Purpose: ensures correct final dimensions after bending
- Example: if part should be 2 inches with 6 inch overall, must subtract bend deduction from flat pattern
- Consequences of incorrect calculation:
  - Flange lengths will be wrong
  - Hole placements incorrect in multi-part designs
  - Entire design can fail
  - Parts will be short on both sides of flanges

### Relationship Between Calculations
- Bend allowance and bend deduction are related
- Both use same key variables: angle, bend radius, thickness, K factor
- Understanding relationship is crucial for accurate design
- Incorrect values in one calculation affects the other

### Practical Importance
- Essential for accurate part design
- Prevents manufacturing errors
- Ensures correct flange lengths
- Critical for hole placement accuracy
- Prevents frustration and manufacturing issues

### Terms
- Bend Allowance - The length of the adjusted center line after bending, measured from tangent point to tangent point, accounting for material elongation during the bending process.
- Bend Deduction - The amount that must be subtracted from the original flat part before bending to achieve the correct final dimensions after bending.
- Angle - The bend angle used in bend allowance and bend deduction calculations.
- Pi (π) - A mathematical constant used as 3.14 in all bending calculations.
- Bend Radius - The radius of the bend, which affects the length of the midline and amount of material deformation.
- K Factor - A material-dependent constant calculated as midline thickness divided by original material thickness, which varies for different materials like stainless steel, steel, and aluminum.
- Material Thickness - The overall thickness of the material being bent, which affects how much material needs to yield during bending.
- Tangent Point - The point where the straight flange meets the curved bend area, used as a reference point for measurements.
- Adjusted Center Line - The center line of the material after bending, which has been elongated due to stretching during the bend process.
- Midline - The center line of the material through the thickness, used in K factor calculations.

## Master Answer Key

1. **B** - The video explicitly states that the two key calculations are bend allowance and bend deduction. These are the main topics covered in the lesson.

2. **A** - The video clearly states that pi (π) is used as 3.14 in all calculations, describing it as a constant from a mathematical standpoint.

3. **A** - The video explains that bend allowance is measured "from tangent point all the way down through to tangent point," making this the correct answer.

4. **C** - The video emphasizes that bend allowance is an "afterbent adjustment or measurement" and clarifies "it's after bending," distinguishing it from bend deduction which is before bending.

5. **C** - The video defines K factor as "midline thickness divided by our original material thickness," making this the correct definition.

6. **C** - The video explains that a larger bend radius means the midline needs to travel further, resulting in more deformation and stretching, which means "we have a lot more bend allowance to take in consideration."

7. **A** - The video states that the K factor "is essentially looking at what material you're using" and "is going to change whether you're doing stainless steel, steel, aluminum," making material type the correct answer.

8. **C** - The video explains that "the thicker the material, the more material needs to yield during that bending process, essentially allowing more bend allowance that we need to have in there."

9. **A** - The video explicitly states that "bend deduction is how much we're going to take off of our original part pre-bent" and emphasizes "this is before bending," making this the correct answer.

10. **C** - The video explains that bend deduction is "how much we're going to take off of our original part pre-bent" to achieve correct final dimensions, making this the correct answer.

11. **C** - The video states that incorrect calculations result in wrong flange lengths and incorrect hole placements in multi-part designs, and that "the whole entire design falls through."

12. **A** - The video uses this exact analogy: "We don't want to throw it to where he's at. We want to throw it to where he's going. This is going to be us throwing it to where we're going."

13. **D** - The video shows that both calculations use angle, bend radius, thickness, and K factor, with bend deduction also incorporating bend allowance in its formula.

14. **D** - The video describes tangent points as the points where measurements are taken, specifically in the context of measuring bend allowance from "tangent point all the way down through to tangent point."

15. **D** - The video explains that the adjusted center line is the center line after bending that accounts for elongation, describing it as showing "that elongation taking effect."

16. **A** - The video explains that bend allowance accounts for the "stretching rubber band effect," thinning, and elongation of flanges that occur during bending.

17. **A** - The video explicitly advises viewers to go back and watch the previous lesson if they haven't seen it or are unfamiliar with the key terms before diving into this lesson.

18. **D** - The video provides an example showing that without proper bend deduction, parts will be short on both sides, giving specific measurements like "5.990" and "1.990" instead of the intended dimensions.

19. **D** - The video defines midline in the context of K factor as "midline thickness divided by our original material thickness," indicating it refers to the center line through the material thickness.
