### Hobbes' Central Problem
- The problem of authority - what makes authority possible and legitimate
- Created the concept of "state of nature" to address this problem
- State of nature is the condition of human life absent authority

### Hobbes' Scientific Methodology
- Strips humans of social ties and customs to see how they would interact
- Views humans as chemical properties in a laboratory test tube 
- Underlying his scientific approach is a powerful moral conception

### Hobbes as Moralist
- Introduced the idiom of individuality into moral language
- Conceived humans through abstraction from attachments
- Views humans as beings defined by willing and choosing
- Life as continual exercise in willing and choosing
- Well-being depends on achieving objects of desires

### Hobbes' Individualism
- Life as competition or struggle
- Fascinated with diversity of human desires
- Moral terms like "good" and "evil" as expressions of likes/dislikes
- "A general inclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire of power after power"

### Hobbes' Skepticism
- Questioned what we can know or are entitled to believe
- Knowledge as human construction based on agreement about shared terms
- Reason has no share in divine intelligence
- Certainty is provisional and subject to revision

### The State of Nature
- Condition of unregulated relations, not isolation
- State of war "of all against all"
- Not permanent fighting but permanent fear and distrust
- Exists whenever authority is not enforced
- Example: locking doors at night demonstrates distrust

### Pride and Fear: Dominant Passions
- Two main passions dominate human nature: pride and fear
- Pride: passion for preeminence, desire to be first
- Fear: desire to avoid death and avoid being seen as a loser
- Fear, not reason, leads humans to abandon state of nature
- Properly directed fear leads to peace

### The Laws of Nature
- Described as "precepts of reason"
- First law: seek peace and follow it
- Nineteen laws constitute framework for civil society
- Comparable to the negative Golden Rule
- Question of moral status: descriptive or prescriptive?
- "The true and only moral philosophy"

### Criticisms of Hobbes' Laws of Nature
- Genuine moral content reduced to "seek peace above all"
- Peace enables industry, knowledge, arts, navigation, etc.
- Peace as means to life, the supreme value
- Self-preservation as both biological fact and moral right
- Hobbes' humanitarianism raises questions about aversion to risk
- Omission of courage from moral virtues
- Societies may require risk-takers despite Hobbes' emphasis on peace

### Terms
- State of Nature - Condition of human life in the absence of authority; characterized by insecurity, fear, and conflict
- Leviathan - Hobbes' metaphor for the sovereign state; taken from Book of Job as "king of the children of pride"
- Laws of Nature - Precepts of reason that lead humans to seek peace; Hobbes identifies nineteen such laws
- Individualism - Hobbes' conception of humans as beings defined by willing and choosing; emphasis on moral agency
- Pride - Passion for preeminence; desire to be first and seen as first
- Fear - Desire to avoid death and avoid being seen as a loser
- Skepticism - Hobbes' view that knowledge lacks transcendent foundations and rests on human agreement
- Sovereign - The authority to which individuals surrender their natural rights for security
- Civil Society - Condition resulting from individuals seeking peace through social contract
- Natural Right - Moral entitlement to self-preservation and means necessary for it
