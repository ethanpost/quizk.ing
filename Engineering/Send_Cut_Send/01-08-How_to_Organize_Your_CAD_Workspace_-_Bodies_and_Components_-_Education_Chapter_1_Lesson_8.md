## Outline

### Introduction to Bodies and Components
- Clean workspace organization principles
- Two key terms: bodies and components
- Bodies: three-dimensional shapes created in CAD
- Components: containers that hold bodies
- Organization methods for CAD success

### Understanding the Container Concept
- File as the main container (drawer analogy)
- Example: SCS washer file as the master container
- Bodies placed inside the master component
- Loose organization without proper structure

### Creating Bodies vs Components
- Extrude process for creating 3D objects
- Profile selection for extrusion
- Distance options: one side, two side, or symmetric
- Operation options: body or component
- Body creation places objects loosely in master file

### Component Organization Benefits
- Components act as separators within files
- Different rules for different components
- Multiple components within same file
- Organized structure like drawer separators
- Each component can hold different bodies

### Practical CAD Implementation
- Extrude tool location in create section
- Profile selection process
- Distance setting (4mm example)
- Operation dropdown: body vs component
- Tree structure changes with components

### Advanced Organization Concepts
- Multiple components for different objects
- Component-specific rules and properties
- Sheet metal considerations
- Material guidelines (K-factor, bend radius)
- Different material thicknesses require separate components

### Future Applications
- Preparation for sheet metal work
- Material-specific properties
- Advanced CAD skills development
- Body modification in next lesson

### Terms
- **Body** – A three-dimensional shape created in CAD
- **Component** – A container that holds bodies and provides organization within a CAD file
- **Extrude** – The process of creating 3D objects from 2D profiles
- **Profile** – A 2D sketch that serves as the base for creating 3D objects
- **Master Component** – The main file container that holds all other components and bodies
- **Tree Structure** – The organizational hierarchy shown in the CAD interface
- **K-factor** – A material property used in sheet metal design for bend calculations
- **Bend Radius** – The radius of curvature when bending sheet metal

## Master Answer Key

1. C – A body is a three-dimensional shape created in CAD, as explained in the lesson introduction.

2. B – The instructor uses a drawer as the analogy for a CAD file, which serves as the main container.

3. D – The two main operation options when extruding are "body" and "component" as shown in the dropdown menu.

4. B – True, bodies created with the "body" option are placed loosely within the master file without organization.

5. D – When creating components, bodies move from the main level into the component's dropdown structure.

6. C – Separate components allow you to apply different rules and properties to different objects within the same file.

7. C – The instructor specifically uses 4 millimeters as the distance setting for the washer extrusion example.

8. B – The entire drawer represents the master component, which is the main file container.

9. D – Components provide better organization and allow for separate rules compared to loose bodies.

10. A – False, you can have multiple components within a single CAD file, as demonstrated in the lesson.

11. D – Material-specific properties like K-factor and bend radius will be important for future sheet metal work.

12. B – The extrude tool is located in the create section of the CAD interface.

13. B – Selecting "new component" places the object in a separate organized section within the file.

14. C – When using components, bodies are found inside the component's dropdown menu in the tree structure.

15. C – Different material thicknesses require separate components to maintain proper organization and rules.
