## Outline

### Introduction to Dimple Forming
- Also referred to as speed holes or aerospace/fighter pilot look
- Process of forming a hole into a dimple
- Adds rigidity and strength to parts
- Removes material while adding structural backbone
- Similar principle to folding paper to add rigidity

### How Dimple Forming Works
- Secondary operation after cutting
- Uses male and female die that press through the hole
- Coining process where dies smash together under pressure
- Material stays in formed shape after dies are removed

### Key Measurements for Dimple Design
- Dimple tool outside diameter: The diameter of the tool that must sit flat on material
- Major diameter: The outside diameter of the dimple itself (where tangent points are)
- Dimple size: The through diameter or actual cutout hole size (what you select)

### Minimum Distance Requirements
- Minimum distance from edge: Prevents edge deformation and ensures full dimple formation
- Minimum distance to bend centerline: Critical to avoid collision between dimple tool and bend die
- Minimum distance between dimples: Based on tool OD and major diameter radius
- All minimum distances depend on die size and dimple size selected
- Must check guidelines for specific dimensions
- For different sized dimples: add radius of first dimple OD + radius of second dimple OD

### Things to Expect with Dimple Forming
- Excessive dimpling on long parts can cause bowing
- Stretching and deformation can cause cupping
- Solution: Add flange bend to add backbone and straighten part
- Tool marks may be visible (cosmetic only)
- Powder coating or anodizing will remove tool marks
- Automatic resizing: SendCutSend resizes holes under 4 inches in diameter
- Minimum part size depends on dimple size selected

### CAD Process for Adding Dimples
- Create sketch on flat part
- Add construction line through center
- Draw circle for dimple size (actual cutout hole)
- Add construction circle equal to dimple tool OD
- Use rectangular pattern to check spacing between dimples
- Ensure tool OD circles don't overlap
- Cut out center holes only (extrude cut)
- Export as DXF (flat part, no forming in CAD)
- Select dimple size and direction (up or down) on SendCutSend website
- Warning: Changing dimple size after design may cause spacing failures

## Master Answer Key

1. **B) It adds strength while reducing weight** - Dimple forming removes material (reducing weight) while adding structural rigidity through the formed backbone, making parts stronger and lighter.

2. **B) Speed holes or aerospace look** - Dimples are commonly nicknamed "speed holes" and give parts an aerospace or fighter pilot aesthetic appearance.

3. **B) It uses male and female dies that press through the hole in a coining process** - The dimple forming process uses two dies (male and female) that press together with high pressure in a coining operation to permanently form the material.

4. **C) The through diameter or actual cutout hole size that you select** - The dimple size is the hole diameter you specify in your design, which is the actual cutout that gets formed into the dimple.

5. **C) The outside diameter of the dimple at the tangent points** - The major diameter is measured at the points where the dimple shape transitions to the flat surface, representing the full extent of the dimple.

6. **B) It prevents edge deformation and ensures full dimple formation** - If dimples are too close to edges, the material deforms and the dimple doesn't form completely, so minimum edge distance is critical.

7. **B) Preventing collision between dimple tooling and bend die** - The dimple tool and bend die need clearance space, so minimum distance to bend centerline prevents tool collisions during manufacturing.

8. **B) Add the radius of the first dimple OD plus the radius of the second dimple OD** - When dimples are different sizes, you calculate spacing by adding the radii of each dimple's tool outside diameter to ensure proper clearance.

9. **B) Bowing and cupping** - Excessive dimpling on long parts causes bowing (curving) and cupping (dishing) due to the stretching and deformation from multiple forming operations.

10. **B) Add a flange bend to add backbone and straighten the part** - A flange bend adds structural rigidity (like folding paper) that counteracts the bowing and cupping effects, straightening the part.

11. **B) Coining process where material is smashed between upper and lower dies** - Tool marks are cosmetic marks left on the surface from the high-pressure coining process where dies press the material.

12. **C) Powder coating or anodizing will remove them** - Tool marks are only cosmetic and can be removed through finishing processes like powder coating or anodizing.

13. **C) 4 inches** - SendCutSend automatically resizes holes under 4 inches in diameter when you select a dimple operation, allowing flexibility in design.

14. **B) The diameter of the tool that must sit completely flat on the material** - The tool outside diameter is the size of the forming tool that needs flat contact with the material surface during the operation.

15. **B) A construction circle equal to the dimple tool OD size** - Drawing a construction circle at the tool OD size helps visualize the clearance area needed and check spacing between dimples in CAD.

16. **B) The part needs to be flat for the DXF export** - Dimple forming is done as a secondary operation by SendCutSend, so the CAD file must be a flat pattern (DXF) without the formed shape.

17. **B) You may get spacing failures in DFM as the dimple sizes won't work** - If you design spacing for one dimple size but change it later, the minimum distance requirements may not be met, causing design for manufacturability (DFM) failures.

18. **B) 0.5 inches** - The smallest standard dimple size available from SendCutSend is half an inch (0.5 inches) in diameter.

19. **B) The dimple size that you are using** - Larger dimples require larger tools and more clearance, so the minimum part size increases with larger dimple sizes.

20. **B) A process where material is pressed between two dies with high pressure to create a permanent shape** - Coining is a metal forming technique that uses high pressure between dies to permanently shape material without cutting.

21. **B) A deformation where a long part curves or bends due to excessive dimpling** - Bowing occurs when multiple dimple operations on a long part cause the material to curve or bend along its length.

22. **B) A deformation where a part develops a curved or dished shape due to stretching during dimple forming** - Cupping happens when the stretching and deformation from dimple forming causes the part to develop a dished or curved surface.
