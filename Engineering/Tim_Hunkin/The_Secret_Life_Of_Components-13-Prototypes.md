## Prototyping Overview

### Introduction
- Prototypes aren't components but essential for trying things out quickly
- Physical prototyping vs digital CAD approach
- Personal experience and techniques for making machines

### Drawing and Design
- Drawing as problem-solving tool
- Knowing when to stop drawing and start making
- Heart of design is in prototyping, not sketching

### Prototyping Materials and Methods
- Cardboard and tape prototyping
- Chipboard/OSB for larger mockups
- Foamex (foamed PVC) for accurate scale models
- Wire frame models using welding wire
- Lego for shape experimentation
- Aluminium profile systems for machine development
- 3D printing for industrial prototyping
- Weld on, grind off technique for mechanisms

### Real-time Prototyping Process
- Making changes and modifications during development
- Testing and iteration cycle
- Learning from failures and successes

### Terms
- Prototype - An early model or version of a product used for testing and development
- Tack weld - A small, temporary weld used to hold pieces together before final welding
- MIG welder - Metal Inert Gas welder that uses a wire electrode and shielding gas
- Foamex - Foamed PVC material used for architectural models and prototyping
- Chipboard - Engineered wood product made from wood chips and resin
- Eccentric - A circular disc mounted off-center on a shaft to create oscillating motion
- Differential gear - A gear system that allows two inputs to combine into one output
- Jack-of-all-trades - Someone skilled in many different areas or crafts
