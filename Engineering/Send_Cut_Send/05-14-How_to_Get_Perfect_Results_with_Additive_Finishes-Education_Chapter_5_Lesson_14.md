## Additive Finishes Overview

### Purpose and Definition
- Final step of design process
- Makes parts robust for field use
- Improves appearance and protection
- Additive finishing adds material to cover or coat parts
- Provides cosmetic improvement and corrosion protection
- Requires designing around the added material

### Dimensional Considerations
- Outer layer makes ID (Inside Diameter) smaller
- Outer layer makes OD (Outside Diameter) larger
- Coating goes all around the part
- Thickness increase affects both outside dimensions and inside holes
- Coating thickness is dictated by finish type
- Must consider tolerance stack up from all operations

### Powder Coating Thickness
- Can range from 4 thousandths to 10 thousandths of an inch
- Variation depends on powder coating type
- Gloss powder coat vs. wrinkle powder coat
- Wrinkle powder coat typically applied much heavier
- Thicker coating with wrinkle type

### Tolerance and Fit Considerations
- Coating thickness on each side of part
- Doubling the width of part by tolerance added
- Must double for ID of holes
- Critical for slip fit applications
- Without accounting for coating, may need to remove powder coating to achieve fit
- Tab and slot assemblies require special consideration
- Both parts coated means tab has coating all around
- Slot has powder coating inside
- Need to add tolerance for powder coating four times for tab and slot assemblies
- Must design around coating or face form and fit issues

### Hanging Process
- Requires a hole for hook placement
- Hole needed for manufacturing process
- Can use existing hole if not too far from edge
- Holes too far from edge (e.g., 2 feet) cannot be used for hanging
- Need hole near edge of part for hook application
- Parts hung on rack during process

### Hardware and Thread Protection
- Holes with hardware (studs) are no longer accessible for hanging
- Hardware pushed in and crimped into holes
- Need to add third hole designated for powder coating process
- May affect cosmetics - plan ahead
- Thread protection on pressed-in hardware
- Hardware installed before powder coating process
- Powder coating goes on outside of hardware
- Thread protection plugs prevent powder coating inside threads
- Prevents need to chase threads after coating

### Final Manufacturing Step
- Last and final step of manufacturing process
- No bending after powder coating - will crack the coating
- Cannot tap holes - removes powder coating in that area
- Can be done but removes coating
- Cannot weld without removing powder coating
- Must think about final fit and form of parts
- Laser engraving is possible
- Can engrave and remove powder coating
- Can etch into coating to change color while maintaining protection

### General Application
- Applies to all additive processes
- Includes coatings from big box stores (e.g., Krylon)
- Includes rubberized coatings
- All coatings add thickness that must be accounted for
- Key is understanding thickness while designing parts

### Terms
- Additive Finishing - A process that adds material to a part to cover or coat it for protection and cosmetic improvement.
- ID (Inside Diameter) - The inner diameter of a hole or opening in a part.
- OD (Outside Diameter) - The outer diameter or outside dimensions of a part.
- Powder Coating - A type of additive finish that applies a dry powder that is cured to form a protective and decorative coating, typically 4-10 thousandths of an inch thick.
- Tolerance Stack Up - The accumulation of dimensional variations from different manufacturing operations that must be considered in design.
- Thread Protection - Plugs or devices inserted into threaded holes to prevent powder coating from entering and coating the threads.
- Tab and Slot - A common assembly method where a tab on one part fits into a slot on another part, requiring careful tolerance consideration when both parts are coated.
- Hanging Process - The method of suspending parts on hooks during powder coating application, requiring accessible holes near part edges.
- Laser Engraving - A process that can be performed on powder coated parts to remove or etch the coating for design purposes.

## Master Answer Key

1. **A** - Additive finishing adds material to parts to cover or coat them for protection and cosmetic improvement, not removing material.

2. **B** - The coating applied to the inside of holes makes the ID smaller because the coating takes up space inside the opening.

3. **C** - The coating applied to the outside surfaces makes the OD larger because material is added to the exterior dimensions.

4. **B** - Powder coating typically ranges from 4-10 thousandths of an inch thick, depending on the type of powder coating used.

5. **C** - Wrinkle powder coat is applied much heavier than gloss powder coat, resulting in a thicker coating.

6. **D** - In tab and slot assemblies, you must account for coating on both sides of the tab and both sides of the slot, totaling four times the coating thickness.

7. **B** - Coating thickness must be doubled because the coating is applied on each side of the part, effectively adding thickness to both surfaces.

8. **B** - The hanging process requires a hole in the part where a hook can be inserted to suspend the part during the powder coating process.

9. **B** - Holes that are too far from the edge (like 2 feet away) cannot be used for hanging because the hook needs to be accessible near the edge.

10. **C** - Once hardware is installed in holes, those holes are no longer accessible for hanging because the hardware blocks the hook insertion.

11. **C** - Hardware is installed before the powder coating process, and then the powder coating is applied over the hardware.

12. **C** - Thread protection plugs are inserted into threaded holes to prevent powder coating from entering and coating the threads, which would require thread chasing later.

13. **B** - Bending a part after powder coating will crack the coating because the coating is rigid and cannot flex with the metal.

14. **C** - Tapping can be done after powder coating, but it removes the powder coating in that specific area where the threads are cut.

15. **C** - Laser engraving can be performed on powder coated parts to either remove coating or etch into it to change color while maintaining protection.

16. **C** - Laser engraving can both remove powder coating completely or etch into it to change the color while keeping the protective coating intact.

17. **C** - Additive finishing is the last and final step of the manufacturing process, after all other operations are complete.

18. **C** - For slip fit applications, you must account for the powder coating thickness because it will reduce the hole size and prevent proper fitting.

19. **B** - The principles apply to all additive processes, including coatings from big box stores and rubberized coatings, not just professional processes.

20. **C** - Understanding the coating thickness while designing is crucial so you can properly account for dimensional changes in your design.

21. **B** - ID stands for Inside Diameter, referring to the inner diameter of holes or openings in a part.

22. **B** - OD stands for Outside Diameter, referring to the outer diameter or outside dimensions of a part.

23. **A** - Tolerance stack up is the accumulation of dimensional variations from different manufacturing operations that must all be considered in the design.

24. **C** - Thread protection refers to plugs or devices inserted into threaded holes to prevent powder coating from entering and coating the threads.

25. **B** - A tab and slot assembly is a method where a tab on one part fits into a slot on another part, commonly used in sheet metal assemblies.

26. **B** - The hanging process is the method of suspending parts on hooks during powder coating application, requiring accessible holes near part edges.
