### Introduction to Key Themes
- Control of the passions as a central moral challenge
  - Every great moral philosopher has a strategy for controlling passions
  - Adeimantus introduces theme of self-control in Book II
- Thumos (spiritedness) as the most powerful political passion
  - Associated with love of fame and distinction
  - Has dual nature: can lead to heroism or domination
  - Story of Leontius illustrates internal conflict of thumos
  - The Republic offers therapies for controlling thumos

### Construction of Kallipolis (The Just City)
- Three waves of reform proposed by Socrates
  - First wave: Restrictions/abolition of private property
  - Second wave: Abolition of the family
  - Third wave: Establishment of philosopher kings
- Co-education of men and women
  - Equal education for both genders
  - Both compete for same jobs regardless of gender
  - Socrates presents this as potentially "laughable" to his audience
  - Includes radical co-educational naked exercise
- Communal family structure
  - Marriage and procreation for the city's sake, not romantic love
  - Children raised communally without knowing biological parents
  - Creates "community of pleasure and pain"
  - Aristotle's critique: common ownership leads to common neglect
- Rewriting laws of war
  - Children as spectators of war
  - "Erotic rewards" for bravery in battle
  - Heroes allowed to kiss anyone they desire as reward

### Justice
- Defined as harmony in both city and soul
- In the city: "one man, one job" principle
  - Each person performs function for which they're best equipped
  - Division of labor creates unity and harmony
- In the soul: three parts working in harmony
  - Reason rules over spiritedness and appetite
  - Mirrors the city's structure (guardians rule auxiliaries and workers)
- Problem of alignment between city and soul
  - City can be just even when most citizens lack just souls
  - Adeimantus questions whether citizens can be happy if deprived of pleasures

### The Philosopher-King
- "Unless philosophers rule as kings or kings philosophize, there will be no rest from ills for cities"
- Presented as outlandish but possibly sincere proposal
  - Plato attempted to advise King Dionysius in Sicily
  - Other philosophers (Hobbes, Rousseau, Marx) sought to guide rulers
- Practical challenges to philosopher-kings
  - Different demands of philosophy versus politics
  - Knowledge of eternal forms may not help with practical governance
  - Philosophers are still human with human weaknesses
  - Absolute power may corrupt even philosophers

### Plato's Views on Modern Democracy
- Republic seems anti-democratic
  - Rejects democratic belief that citizens can participate in government
- Plato's critique of democracy remains relevant
  - Democratic soul pursues whatever desires arise without order
  - Modern democracies foster conformism and "soft nihilism"
  - Democracy oscillates between lawlessness and tyranny
  - "Saying whatever comes to our lips" without restraint
- Positive aspects of democracy
  - Produced and tolerated Socrates
  - "Worst regime except for all others" (Churchill's later sentiment)
- Kallipolis as metaphor for soul's education
  - Political reform begins with self-reform
  - Philosophers who become tyrants mistake philosophy's purpose
  - True philosophy is therapy for passions, not basis for domination

### Terms
- Thumos - Spiritedness; a powerful political passion associated with love of fame and distinction, anger, and ambition; can lead to heroism or tyranny
- Kallipolis - The "beautiful city" or ideally just city designed by Socrates in the Republic
- Philosopher-king - Plato's proposal that philosophers should rule as kings or kings should become philosophers
- Justice - Harmony in which each part performs its proper function; in the soul, reason controls spirit and appetite; in the city, each person does the job they're naturally suited for
- Self-guardianship - Concept introduced by Adeimantus referring to self-control and protection from injustice
- Community of pleasure and pain - Socrates' description of the guardian class sharing collective experiences rather than individual ones
- Democratic soul - Person who lives without order, pursuing whatever desire arises, calling this life "sweet, free, and blessed"
- Three parts of the soul - Reason, spiritedness (thumos), and appetite
- Three classes of the city - Guardians (rulers), auxiliaries (warriors), and workers/artisans
